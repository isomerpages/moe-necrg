### Oasis at The End of Life

While serious illness, death and dying are one of the topics furthest away from the minds of youths today, it is one that should be introduced and made comfortable with, for death is a natural part of life. It is too commonly misunderstood that hospice care is one of despair, gloom and hopelessness. But in actuality, hospice care seeks to bring comfort, dignity and hope into the very limited time patients have with their family members. Hospice care is truly about life. 

Join HCA for a learning journey to our day hospice – a day care centre for the terminally ill – and witness how life-giving and hopeful hospice care can be. The learning journey will entail a tour of the facility and a context-setting presentation on what hospice and palliative care is and the types of services available. Together, let us explore Oasis where every life is valued, cherished, and celebrated with utmost care and compassion.
