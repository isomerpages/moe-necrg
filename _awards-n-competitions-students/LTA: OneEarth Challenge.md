### OneEarth Challenge
The programme uses gamification to encourage primary school students to travel to school by car-lite modes. OneEarth inculcates car-lite attitudes and behaviours among school children and can potentially help to alleviate congestion outside schools. Beyond the car-lite theme, LTA also partners with relevant environmental agencies to deliver a holistic environmental messaging to students.

**Details**

Every morning, students scan in their individual QR cards at iPad stations and earn energy for travelling by car-lite modes (walk/cycle/ride), and lesser energy for travelling by car. Students can then login to a virtual world to spend their energy to work towards individual, team, and school goals by interacting with car-lite themed quizzes and mini-games.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will learn the importance of car-lite travel, and how they each can play their part to care for the environment.

*We are currently running low-fidelity version of OneEarth Challenge (OEC), known as Car-Free Challenge (CFC) as an interim measure to keep schools and students warm before the first OEC run in 2024. Since OEC is targeted at upper primary students, we are planning to run CFC concurrently for the lower primary cohorts so that the entire school can participate.

**Target Audience**: Primary 4- P6 students

**Runtime:** 2-3 weeks per year

**Fee:** Please email for more details.

**Modality:** In-person

**Duration of Session**: Runs every morning for 2-3 weeks, during the pre-assembly period as students are arriving in school.

**Capacity:** We recommend 2 cohorts for participating schools.

**Relevant Commemorative Days**: Earth Day

**Mode of registration:** By email.

**Due Date for registration**: 2 months in advance

**Contact**: oneearth@lta.gov.sg
