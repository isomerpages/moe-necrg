<h3>World Para Swimming Championships Learning Journey</h3>

</p>
<p>The World Para Swimming Championships, the highest level competition for
Para swimmers outside the Paralympic Games, will take place in Asia for
the first time in September 2025. Singapore has been selected as the proud
host of this prestigious event, and is recognising it as an SG60 Signature
Event to promote our nationâ€™s shared journey and future towards an inclusive
and caring society.</p>
<p>The event will bring together over 600 top Para swimmers with physical,
visual and intellectual disabilities from more than 60 countries, and showcase
the determination and excellence of Para athletes. TeamSG 7-time Paralympic
medalist Yip Pin Xiu, Commonwealth Games medalist Toh Wei Soong and Paralympian
Sophie Soon have met the qualifying standards to compete in this World
Championships.</p>
<p>We are excited to extend an opportunity for your school to inspire students,
promote inclusivity, and raise awareness about disability sports and athletes
with disabilities.</p>
<p>Students will get the opportunity to be motivated and learn about values
such as resilience as they cheer for disabled athletes who are competing
in the championships. They will also have the opportunity to participate
in meet and greet sessions with Singapore National Para-athletes, and develop
a sense of empathy as they get to try para sports and understand the challenges
that para athletes overcome.</p>
