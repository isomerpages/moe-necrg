### Museum-Based Learning: Sights & Sounds of Little India

Trained to engage with children, our ensemble of passionate Museum Educators thematically impart knowledge and insights into the culture and heritage of the Indian community in Singapore. The multi-sensory learning experience includes storytelling with hands-on activities and interactive tactile objects.

Designed to complement the National Education and Social School Studies (Primary 5) curriculum, the programme will also take students through the vibrant Campbell Lane with stops at various businesses. Students will be engaged with stories on the area’s long-standing trades and businesses, among other exciting highlights. By the end of the day, the young attendees will be able to walk away with a keener understanding of the Indian culture and the community’s contributions towards the development of Singapore and better appreciate their imprints on the city’s multi-cultural fabric.Led by Museum Educators, Primary 5 students will visit the Indian Heritage Centre to learn about the culture and heritage of the Indian community in Singapore, their contributions to Singapore through the theme of Indian cultural art forms (performing arts). Students will also explore the galleries at the Indian Heritage Centre and the Little India precinct to understand the various trades and businesses that have survived for generations.
