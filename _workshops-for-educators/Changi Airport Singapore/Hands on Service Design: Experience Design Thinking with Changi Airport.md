Changi Airport is one of the world’s best airports, and passengers frequently wax lyrical about the “Changi Experience”. At the heart of it, this excellent passenger experience is only made possible through meticulous attention to detail in service design. 
Participants will discover how CAG applies Design Thinking methodology in service design, leveraging various tools to understand, design and test ideas that bring positive impact to our passengers’ lives. Participants will also be challenged to reflect on their own experience with service design and how they might approach it.
