<h3>Kindness Day SG Celebrations</h3>
<p><strong>Name of Organisation: </strong>Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM)</p>
<p><strong>Programme Type:</strong> Campaign</p>
<p><strong>Programme Details:</strong>
</p>
<p>Kindness Day SG, on 23 May 2025, is a special day in Singapore when everyone
comes together to celebrate kindness! It’s a reminder to go the extra mile
to connect with others, show care and express gratitude.</p>
<p>Whom would you like to show your appreciation and kindness to? Could it
be a family member, a classmate, a school staff member or someone in the
community who makes a difference to our lives, such as a public transport
worker or a healthcare worker? What can you do to brighten their day? Together,
we can create a ripple effect of kindness!</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to use the perforated cards in the Kindsville
Times / A-OK! publications to write a message to someone who has made a
difference in their lives to express their appreciation.</p>
<p>Students can also participate in the Write to Singa activity, or join
the contest within the issue as part of the celebration.</p>
<p>SKM would like to appeal for schools’ support to post celebrations of
Kindness Day SG on schools’ social media, and use #KindnessDaySG, along
with #WeAreGratefulSG, and tag @kindnessSG to share how students are spreading
kindness.</p>
<p><strong>Programme Runtime:</strong> March to May</p>
<p><strong>Target Audience: </strong>Primary school students</p>
