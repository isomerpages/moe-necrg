> “It was heartening to see students and residents bringing their neighbours, friends and families to this carnival. This carnival was a good way to bring residents together to encourage neighbourliness. It was also very encouraging to see residents writing notes and gifting their plants, badges and coasters to their friends and neighbours.”

– Ms Jasmine Wong, Teacher of West Spring Primary School

> “The game was useful to share with participants how to keep their corridors clean and tidy and encourage people to be a better neighbour.”

– Srihan, Primary 4 student, West Spring Primary School

> “The VIA project that we did was an enriching and entertaining way to contribute to saving the Earth. I personally believe that the activity conducted had benefited both the elderly and us. Overall, it was a fun and fulfilling activity.”
