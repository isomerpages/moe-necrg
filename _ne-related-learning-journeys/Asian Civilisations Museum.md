# Museum-Based Learning: Asian Adventures
Ever wondered what life in Southeast Asia was like in the past? Students go on a journey to uncover stories, engage actively with artefacts and have a discussion with trained Museum Educators (MEs) to consider this question. Students will also get an opportunity to handle objects in this interactive experience. This programme has been developed as part of the Social Studies and Character and
Citizenship Education cohort learning journey.

**Details**
Students will visit 6 different stations and be guided by Museum Educators. They will listen to stories from the past, be engaged in discussion with the guides, handle objects and complete activities in their activity booklet. This will guide them to answer the question:
*What was life in Southeast Asia like in the past?*

Participants will:
* Understand the cultural and historical ties that have been influenced by the countries in Southeast Asia
* Explore how Singapore's cultural heritage has evolved over time, influenced by the mix of cultures

> “I like the part when we get to listen to stories by the Museum Educators. The most memorable moment was when I got to see real objects from the past."

*Primary 6 students who attended the MBL onsite programme*

> “As an art teacher, the programme connects content of different subjects especially when the P6s are learning them in the classroom. For example, students learn about the 'fusion' of symbolic creatures to form
their own 'identity'."
