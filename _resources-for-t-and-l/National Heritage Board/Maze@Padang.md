Maze@Padang is a digital game where students will be transported to an underground Minecraft maze located beneath the Padang. They will search for clues and answer questions relating to the history of the Padang in a bid to escape the maze.  

The Padang is our newest National Monument, which was gazetted last year on 9 August as our 75th National Monument. The site holds great significance to the history of Singapore – it is associated with key milestones in Singapore’s history, including the victory parade celebrating the formal surrender of the Japanese in Singapore on 12 September 1945, the victory rally of the first fully elected Legislative Assembly on 3 June 1959, the installation of Mr Yusof Ishak as the first Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara (head of state) and the unveiling of National Symbols on 3 December 1959, as well as the inaugural National Day Parade on 9 August 1966. Students will also be able to relate the learnings from this game to what they have studied in their textbooks.
