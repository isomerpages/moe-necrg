<blockquote>
<p>“Thinking back on my students who participated in Write for Kindness,
there was a general improvement in terms of them taking their own initiative
to perform acts of kindness. Although it was not measurable, I personally
feel that they are more aware given what they wrote about and reflected
upon and would act accordingly.” – Secondary School Teacher</p>
