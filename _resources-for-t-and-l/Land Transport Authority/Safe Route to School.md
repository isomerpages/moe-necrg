There are often safety concerns raised about young students crossing side roads and accesses unassisted, especially during morning peak hours. Infrastructure can help enhance safety to an extent, but students still need to be able to exercise judgement. Additional help would be useful for students to exercise good
judgement and awareness when crossing housing or carpark accesses and side roads.

The Safe Route to School (SRS) project aims to co-create
solutions with the school and community to encourage young
students to take a safer walking route to school from nearby
transport nodes. It is also the intention for the project to involve
students to brainstorm and participate actively in enhancing
road safety around their school environment by designing
suitable traffic information signs. Displaying the winning designs
as traffic information signs would instill pride and also help
students appreciate that they can positively influence the road
safety environment. Where possible, the school supports further
with marshals to reinforce the recommended walking route.

**Details**

1. Engage school management to discuss the existing walking routes of students and map out the recommended routes to the various school pedestrian gates from the nearest transport nodes, followed by placement of additional marshals or volunteers to nudge the students to use the recommended route. 
2. Involve the students to brainstorm and design artwork that is aligned with the intent of the project to encourage the students to take a safer walking route to school and raise motorists’ awareness of students’ presence on the road. This was put forward as a “drawing competition” to spark more interest. The schools and LTA then chose suitable artwork that can be developed into road signs.

**Learning Objectives**

The project provides a useful opportunity for the school and community to be more actively involved in promoting safety awareness in the school environs. Through multiple discussions and site walks, stakeholder agencies and students collaborated to identify walking routes to improve and brainstorm solutions. With a common objective of increasing students’ safety, the different agencies sought to arrive at optimal collaborative solutions. Bearing in mind that infrastructure changes is only part of the solution, the outcome had to involve changing the
behavior of students themselves. This ‘inclusive’ initiative instils pride among students and sense of appreciation for their positive role and influence for road safety environment.
