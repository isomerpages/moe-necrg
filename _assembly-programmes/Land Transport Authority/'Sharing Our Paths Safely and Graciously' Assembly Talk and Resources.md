A 25-minute physical/virtual talk for primary and secondary students that covers safe riding practices for Active Mobility Device (e.g. bicycle, kick-scooter) users, as well as tips and habits for pedestrians to adopt on paths to ensure safety.

Self-help resources (in the form of slides and videos), adapted from the talk, are also available if schools/teachers wish to augment LTAâ€™s sharing in the classroom.

**Details**

**Physical Talk**: An LTA speaker will conduct the talk in the school hall. There will be short videos and quizzes to engage students.

**Virtual Talk**: An LTA speaker will conduct the talk over Zoom/Microsoft Teams. Students will attend the talk in their respective classes, whereby class teachers will log in to their Zoom/Teams account and flash the talk on the class screen. Short quizzes will be conducted through Zoom/Teams poll/chat functions.

**Self-help resources**: Teachers can use the self-help resources (slides and videos) to share on the safe riding behaviours, safety tips and habits that active mobility users and pedestrians can adopt when walking or riding on public paths during PE or CCE class.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will find out more on how pedestrians and active mobility device users can share public paths safely and graciously. They will gain a better understanding of active mobility rules, safety tips and habits that they can adopt when walking or riding on public paths.
