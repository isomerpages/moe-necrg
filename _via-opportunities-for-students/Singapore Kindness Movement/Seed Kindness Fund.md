<h3>Singapore Kindness Movement</h3>
<h4>Seed Kindness Fund</h4>
<p>Want to achieve a more gracious society by encouraging everyone to start,
show and spread kindness? The Seed Kindness Fund (SKF) supports kindness
community projects by youths aged 13-26 years old. SKF funds up to a $1,000
for each project that makes a positive difference in Singapore’s society.
Each project will receive 60% of funds upon approval, and the remaining
40% of funds after the project is completed.  </p>
<p>Students can choose to unleash their own creative ideas or support and
take up our partners’ project briefs. Our partners include the National
Library Board, Cyber Security Agency, National Council of Social Services,
Land Transport Authority, Media Literacy Council, Ministry of Manpower,
Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Housing Development Board, and
FairPrice.</p>

<p>“With SKM’s partnership, students have gained invaluable experiences working
with the different community groups. They have also learnt about and fostered
kindness and inclusivity in the community as they executed these projects.
We are very grateful for this opportunity to work with you and your team.”</p>
