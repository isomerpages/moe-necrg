Bring your students on an exploratory journey to learn about the experiences of prisoners of war and internees during the Japanese Occupation.

**Details**

The newly revamped Changi Chapel and Museum (CCM) showcases stories and personal objects from families of former internees that emphasise their personal experiences during the Japanese Occupation. Through a self-guided exploration of the museum, complemented by our age-appropriate education resources designed for primary and secondary levels, students will be encouraged to
contemplate both the hardships that the internees underwent, as well as their courage and resilience in the face of difficulties.

**Learning Objectives**

* Encourage empathy for and reflection on the experiences of former internees of Changi Prison
