PABL augments music learning in class with customised out-of-school learning experiences that deepen studentsâ€™ appreciation of music of
Singapore and the world. It is supported by the National Arts Council (NAC) and in
collaboration with key music and cultural institutions such as the Esplanade, Singapore Chinese Orchestra (SCO), Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) and Metropolitan Festival Orchestra (MFO). PABL is slated to be implemented in 2023 as a core learning experience for Lower Secondary students in the revised Primary and Lower Secondary Music Syllabus.
