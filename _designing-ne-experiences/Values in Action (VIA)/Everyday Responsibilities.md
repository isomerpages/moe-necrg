Schools inculcate a sense of responsibility and care in students, for their
own space and for shared spaces. Cleaning is carried out in the
classrooms and common areas. Most schools already incorporate five to
ten minutes of cleaning activities in their classrooms each day. The
learning from schools can be transferred to the home environment and
with this constant practice, students learn pro-social behaviours and
cultivate good life habits.

As part of encouraging students to adopt sustainability practices, ER will
be enhanced to include the following initiatives as part of the daily habits
in schools. Schools can choose to include any of the five initiatives above
as part of strengthening Everyday Responsibilities (ER).
