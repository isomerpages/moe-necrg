# Outreach to Young and Youth (OHYAY!) Programme

HDBâ€™s OHYAY! programme seeks to raise awareness on good neighbourly messages and to nurture students in building active and caring communities in the heartlands.

Students will attend a digital roadshow and will be encouraged to complete an e-learning module as part of post-roadshow engagement which helps reinforce the key messages learnt.

**Details**

The outreach consists of a digital roadshow and an e-learning module. The digital roadshow engages students through an audio-visual presentation and quizzes while the e-learning module reinforces the values learnt through infographic sharing and role play.

**Learning Objectives**

Primary school students will learn and pick up responsible neighbourly behaviour and practical eco-friendly practices. Secondary school students will learn how the design of public housing facilitates the building of communities and how they can contribute towards promoting active and caring community bonds.

> "The programme was very engaging with well-crafted storyline and theme. The students got to learn as they enjoyed themselves!"
