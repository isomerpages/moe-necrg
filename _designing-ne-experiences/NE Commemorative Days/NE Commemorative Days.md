Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day are commemorative days which are important opportunities for students to deepen their appreciation of our shared past, develop critical knowledge of Singapore’s realities, and strengthen students’ sense of ownership towards co-creating our future.

**15 Feb - Total Defence Day (TDD)**
**Theme: Together We Keep Singapore Strong**

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February each year to mark the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, our students reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's best all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore(e.g. terrorism, pandemics,cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic crises). Students also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core message of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life. 

**6 Apr - International Friendship Day (IFD)
Theme: Singapore in Asia**


Schools commemorate IFD for students to reflect on the importance of the following to Singapore

• an active foreign policy to maintain our international space

• openness to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent

• cross-cultural skills and a global orientation

• mutual respect and understanding to maintain social cohesion in our multi-cultural society

**21 Jul - Racial Harmony Day (RHD)
Theme: Singapore: Our Multi-cultural Mosaic**

RHD marks the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. Schools commemorate RHD for our students to celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures, requiring collaborative efforts from all to promote social cohesion and harmony.

**9 Aug - National Day (ND)
Theme: to be confirmed closer to the date**
*Schools to commemorate National Day on 8 August *

National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence as an independent country in a community of nations. Since 1998, schools have commemorated National Day for students to reflect on the historical importance and solemnity of National Day.
