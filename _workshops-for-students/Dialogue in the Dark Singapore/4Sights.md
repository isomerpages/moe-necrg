Learning some Braille

> “I want to thank all of you for a smooth programme and an enjoyable visit to DiD. All your staff were energetic and very interactive with the children. It was very enriching and the children learnt a lot from it. I especially appreciated giving every child the opportunity to try out the canes and that you got child sizes that fit them perfectly.”
