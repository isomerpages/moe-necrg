Take a trip with us to the cultural heartland of Kreta Ayer and learn more about the contributions of the Chinese community! Students, playing the role of young journalists, will visit Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery and study the Intangible Cultural Heritage of five cultural arts – Chinese Opera, Chinese Puppetry, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Tea and Nanyin music. They will also learn about the history of a famous street, Sago Lane, and the heritage of the shophouses there.

**Details**

The learning journey will feature four stations located around Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery. Each station will feature activities and/or demonstrations that will engage the students in applying their field work skills, such as asking questions and gathering data through observation and stories.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will be guided to recognise the contributions made by the Chinese community in the development of Singapore and understand the importance of knowing Singapore’s history and multicultural heritage, as well as the stories of the different people who came to Singapore to make up Singapore society,
and the stories of our families.

> “ The puppetry was very interesting because it was a popular form of entertainment in the past. Now, puppetry is not that popular and not seen often. It
tells me that Kreta Ayer is a place where heritage is appreciated."

They are knowledgeable in their areas. As a teacher,
