For the program, ‘Be a Vigilant Commuter’, we will be sharing the importance on public transport security and highlights of past incidents from other countries and Singapore. The presentation will empower the students with the knowledge and tools to identify and report security threats including basic first aid skills during your daily commute fostering a vigilant and united community that looks out for one another. 

In the presentation, we emphasize the critical role each one of us plays in enhancing public transport security. By being vigilant, alert, and actively participating in the "See Something, Say Something" campaign, we can take an active role in protecting our public transport system and contribute to a safer and more secure Singapore.

There will be interactive activities and quizzes related to Public Transport Security to educate and engage the students. These activities will allow the students to practice identifying potential security threats and teaching them the appropriate steps to take during emergencies. To acknowledge the students' participation and enthusiasm, there will be exciting prizes and tokens of appreciation for those who actively engaged in the interactive activities and quizzes. We will provide the school with our ‘See Something Say Something’ campaign posters and students with brochures during the assembly talk. You have the option to engage us for an assembly talk (approximate of 30-45mins) or an engagement booth set up during recess time or, if the school schedule permits, we can do both as well.
