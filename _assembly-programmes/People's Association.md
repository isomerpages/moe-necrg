### Chingay National Education (NE) Programme

PA started the Chingay NE Programme, comprising assembly Programme and the NE Show, in 2013 to introduce Chingay Parade to students. Since 2013, the NE Programme  has become an annual feature of Chingay Parade. It introduces and inculcates important values which are key to nation-building through creative, engaging and interactive activities. Through this programme, it hopes to enable the students to understand the meaning behind Chingay, how it brings people together to co-create this People’s Parade and to appreciate the multi-culturalism and diversity of Singapore.

**Details**

The assembly programme can either be conducted in assembly halls or lecture theatres in schools. Facilitators will bring the students through the programme through story-telling format and the students will also be engaged in some interactive activities like physical exercises and quizzes.  Some of the students will also attend the NE Show which is the full-dress rehearsal for the parade at F1 Pit Building where they will enjoy the performances and the floats co-created by people from all walks of life.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will learn the origin of Chingay Parade and how Chingay highlights the multi-cultural aspect of Singapore. Students will also appreciate how people of Singapore come together to co-create and put together this People’s Parade and understand how they can also contribute and be engaged to be part of this event.
