### Values in Action (VIA)

The [Values In Action](https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/cce-2021-main-sdcd/wiki/page/view?title=Values+in+Action+%28VIA%29-+beta) experience nurtures in students a commitment to address concerns of the community and nation, and encourages students to exercise ownership of the community and initiate ways to contribute to the nation.

       

### [**Everyday Responsibilities**](https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/cce-2021-main-sdcd/wiki/page/view?title=Daily+Routines+-+Everyday+Responsibilities)

Schools inculcate a sense of responsibility and care in students, for their own space and for shared spaces. Cleaning is carried out in the classrooms and common areas. Most schools already incorporate five to ten minutes of cleaning activities in their classrooms each day. The learning from schools can be transferred to the home environment and, with this constant practice, students learn pro-social behaviours and cultivate good life habits.
