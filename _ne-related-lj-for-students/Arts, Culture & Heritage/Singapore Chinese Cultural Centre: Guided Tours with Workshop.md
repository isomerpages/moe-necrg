Facilitator-led guided tour of SCCC’s SINGAPO人exhibition followed by hands-on activity.

**Details**

What does “SINGAPO人”have to share about Chinese culture in Singapore? In this guided tour of Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre’s exhibition, “SINGAPO人: Discovering Chinese Singaporean Culture”, our trained facilitators will lead students to explore what makes up Chinese Singaporean culture through daily life – common food, language, and festivals. Students will uncover the factors which
influence the shaping of culture and how this identity has evolved over time and continues to change today. Complete the guided tour with a hands-on segment where students can express their creativity and originality through a range of activities from craft and art making, to music making and song writing. Our exhibition is open from 10am to 8pm daily, except Mondays, when we are open from 2pm to 8pm. School groups may request to visit the exhibition earlier at 9am. A minimum of 20 students is required for such requests.
