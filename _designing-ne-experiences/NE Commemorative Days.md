<h5><strong>NE Commemorative Days</strong></h5>
<p>National Education (NE) Commemorative Days are linked to defining moments
in Singapore's history. Schools can customise learning activities and follow
up with programmes to create holistic&nbsp;learning experiences for our
students.</p>

<p><strong>Theme: Together We Keep Singapore Strong</strong>
</p>
<p>Schools commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February each year to mark
the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, our
students reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's best
all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore(e.g.
terrorism, pandemics, cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic crises).
Students also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of
Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social
Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core
message of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to
protect Singapore and our shared way of life.</p>

</p>
<p>Schools commemorate International Friendship Day on the 3rd Friday of
Term 2. This is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations
with neighbouring countries and beyond. The commemoration of IFD allows
our students to be sensitised to Singapore's geopolitical realities, and
to reflect on the importance of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an active foreign policy to maintain Singapore's international space;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>openness to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cross-cultural skills and a global orientation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the spirit of friendship and collaboration amongst different people.</p>

</ul>

<p>Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on 21 July each year to mark
the anniversary of the 1964 race riots. On this day, students reflect on
and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity
of cultures and the collaborative effort of all to promote social cohesion.</p>

</p>
<p>*Schools to commemorate National Day on 7 August 2026</p>
<p>National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence
as an independent country in a community of nations. The school-based commemoration
brings to students a sense of the historical importance and solemnity of
National Day.</p>
