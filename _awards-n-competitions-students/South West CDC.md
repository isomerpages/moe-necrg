# Green Schools @ South West - Young Technopreneur Challenge

The Green Schools @ South West programme is organised by South West CDC and supported by the National Environment Council (NEA), to educate and instil public responsibility for our environment in children and youths through mainstream education. The programme reaches out to Primary, Secondary and Post-Secondary students in the District.

The Young Technopreneur Challenge (co-organised by HP Inc, Junior Achievement (JA) Singapore and South West CDC) is part of the Green Schools @ South West programme to encourage students to take ownership of the world they live in and actively develop solutions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Through Young Technopreneur Challenge, we hope to empower students to become problem solvers, innovators and entrepreneurs by providing expert advice and mentorship combined with skills development and training.

**Details**

The challenge consists of three bootcamps where students will develop their ideas, go through a rigorous design thinking process, research and prototype, as well as learn about the steps to becoming a technopreneur. It culminates in an expo event where students will showcase and present their ideas to a range of industry judges – winners possibly taking home funding to support the
development of their idea.

**Learning Objectives**

The students have to register in teams of four, and brainstorm ideas using the STEM concept to an environmental problem related to one of the three sustainability plans – (1) UN Sustainable Development Goals, (2) Singapore Green Plan 2030 and (3) Sustainable South West Masterplan. Mentors will be assigned to the teams to guide them in the development of ideas for their final presentation.
