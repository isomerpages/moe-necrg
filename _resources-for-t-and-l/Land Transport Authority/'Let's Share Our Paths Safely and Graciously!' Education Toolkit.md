A teachers’ self-help toolkit packed with activities to conduct in classrooms. The toolkit includes a [Students' Activity Book](https://go.gov.sg/studentactivitybook) which contains worksheets and games; a [Teachers' Guide](https://go.gov.sg/amteachersguide) that provides suggestions for activities and learning points; and a video jingle.

**Details**

The Teachers’ Guide provides teachers with instructions to conduct the classroom activities in the Students’ Activity Book. The Guide also equips teachers with rationale behind suggested safe riding behaviours.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will find out more on how pedestrians and active mobility device users can share public paths safely and graciously. They will gain a better understanding of active mobility rules, safety tips and habits that they can adopt when walking or riding on public paths.

**Target Audience**: Primary 1- P2 students

**Runtime**: All year round

**Fee**: Complimentary

**Modality**: In-person

**Duration of Session**:        We recommend that teachers spend about an hour going through the activities provided in the toolkit.
