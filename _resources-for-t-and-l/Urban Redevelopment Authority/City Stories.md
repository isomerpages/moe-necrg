A collaboration between the School of Art, Design and Media, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority, this online resource invites students to learn more about the rich history of Singaporeâ€™s Amoy and Telok Ayer Streets. This community storytelling website combines urban and ethnic studies to help share public narratives of place and geographies of cultural memory embedded in this historic district.

This is an online resource that students and educators can explore and use for reference.

**Details**

City Stories is an online resource that can be accessed by educators, parents and students.

**Learning Objectives**

Students and educators will be able to use the City Stories platform to go on a virtual tour of the streets via video interviews with past residents as well as researchers and scholars. They can also scroll through the neighbourhood as if one were present on-site with streetscape photos as well as maps, paintings and other materials that capture a glimpse of these evolving streets.
