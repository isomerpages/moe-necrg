Current local and global trends have the potential to influence how our students perceive and understand issues that impact Singapore:

**• Changing Demographics:**
Rising number of elderly citizens, more diverse resident and student population profile;

**• Evolving socio-political climate:**
A more informed population wanting greater say innpolitical and social matters, greater exchange of ideas through social media, and emergence of civic advocacy groups;

**• Disruptions are occurring more quickly:**
Prolonged geopolitical insecurity, stagflation, climate crisis, pandemic insecurity 

NE provides opportunities for our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values. In view of the changing local and global contexts, NE needs to be empowering, aspirational and inspire all of us to take collective ownership of our future as a nation.
