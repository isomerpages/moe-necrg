##### **Thrust 1: A Shared and Lively Narrative**
Develop a multi-dimensional Singapore Story that includes voices and experiences from our students and discussions of Singaporeâ€™s contemporary realities through issues.

##### **Thrust 2: Empowering Citizenship Experiences**
Design learning experiences that allow students to exercise ownership of the community, build stronger relationships with their peers in an increasingly diverse society, and initiate ways to contribute to the nation in order to nurture a commitment to take action.

##### **Thrust 3: A Professional Community Engaged in Pedagogical Innovation**
Make sense of our own and collective citizenship experiences to become more adept and confident in guiding our students through their NE experiences.
