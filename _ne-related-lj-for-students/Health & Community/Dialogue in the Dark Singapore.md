# SIGNATURE TOUR IN THE DARK
For this experiential learning journey, participants walk through themed rooms that simulate real life situations and environments – such as a park, a busy street and a café – in complete darkness. As they explore in darkness, they are challenged to rely on their other senses, collaborate and communicate more clearly, develop empathy and better appreciate their sense of sight.

**Details**

Led by a guide who is blind, participants will enter the themed rooms in groups of eight for a guided tour. The guide will conduct a short debrief and facilitate a discussion about challenges that blind people face on a daily basis.

**Learning Objectives**

Participants will:
* Gain an awareness of the challenges faced by the blind and their resilience
* Appreciate their own sense of sight
* Learn to better communicate and collaborate with each other
