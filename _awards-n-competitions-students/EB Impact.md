<h2>The Sustainability Youth Festival</h2>
<p>The Sustainability Youth Festival (TSYF) is designed to be a platform
for youths to learn about sustainability issues in an accessible and engaging
way. It offers a space that aims to break down the barriers to understanding
sustainability as a topic through hands-on activities, and for youths to
network and learn from professionals in the sector who are passionate about
making a difference.</p>
<p>At the core of the festival is the TSYF Challenge, where youth teams will
be given the opportunity to pitch their innovative projects and win awards
and funding, bringing their ideas to life in schools and communities.</p>
