<h3>Museum-based Learning: Artefactually Speaking at the National Museum</h3>
<p>In this artefact-centric programme, co-developed with the Ministry of
Education, students will explore the National Museum's galleries in independent
groups while guided by a Passport activity booklet. They will also get
to discover fascinating stories about specific artefacts from Singapore’s
700 years of history as they interact with our Museum Educators.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>This facilitated programme empowers students to independently explore
the galleries, while looking for Museum Educators who will share stories
and converse with them about the museum's artefacts and Singapore's past.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives: </strong>Students will understand how different
groups or individuals in Singapore’s history created connections with one
another, places and experiences. The programme also aims to spark curiosity
in students to think about connections in their daily lives.</p>
