Dear fellow educators,

Our world today is increasingly inter-connnected. Events or issues that occur far away can impact Singapore instanteously and affect us in ways that we may not realize. National Education plays a vital role in equipping our students with the knowledge and skills to navigate the complex challenges of the modern world.

Through NECRG, we hope to support you in the important work that you do. It will showcase up-to-date resources, workshops and NE-related Learning Journeys from our partners, for both educators and students.

We hope that the NE Community Resource Guide (NECRG) will aid you in your efforts to explore resources and consider how you could approach NE differently to inspire both staff and students. As you and your students engage with these learning experiences, we hope you discover for yourselves what Singapore and being Singaporean truly means to you.

If you would like to provide feedback on NECRG, we would love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact us at MOE_CCEB@moe.gov.sg.

Wishing you a wonderful and exciting 2025 ahead!

The NE Resource Guide Team (Joel & Mun Ling)
