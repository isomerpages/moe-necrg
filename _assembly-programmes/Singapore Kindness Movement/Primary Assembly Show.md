SKM’s assembly show in interactive drama format explores various topics such as Cyber Kindness and Embracing Diversity. The show aspires to shine light on relevant contemporary issues to spark meaningful conversations among students.

**Details**

The programme will be conducted by recreating familiar scenarios and introducing new settings within the local context to educate the students on Friendship, Embracing Diversity, Respect, Managing Screen Time and Positive Online Etiquette.
