<h2>The Sustainability Youth Festival</h2>
<p>The Sustainability Youth Festival is a celebration aimed at amplifying
youth voices and driving Singapore's sustainable development. This event
unites students, schools, government agencies, and corporate industry leaders,
providing a vibrant platform for young individuals to dive into sustainability
topics, share innovative ideas, and connect with like-minded peers and
organisations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>At the core of the festival is a challenge where students can pitch their
solutions in two categories: Youth Changemaker: solutions focused on awareness
and behavioural change Youth Innovator: solutions that are viable products
or services aimed at making direct environmental impact For students not
participating in the challenge, there are still a variety of activities
to enjoy! The festival will also consist of fringe activities such as booths
hosted by local startups, NGOs, and sustainability-focused companies and
engaging hands-on activities led by our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives: </strong>Students will learn about Singapore's
sustainability challenges and the diverse approaches being taken to overcome
them, all of which will be aligned with the Green Plan. They will have

deeper understanding of the issues at hand and inspiring them to contribute
to a more sustainable future.</p>
