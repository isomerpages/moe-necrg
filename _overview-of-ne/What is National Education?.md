National Education (NE) was launched in 1997. As a significant aspect of CCE, NE comprises a wide range of school efforts that aims to:

•** Provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values** to understand Singapore’s history, realities and challenges unique to our nation, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.

• **Be empowering and aspirational** allowing for individual sense-making, so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional, and global issues.

• **Help our students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans** and foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope which motivates our students to play a contributory role in their immediate communities and in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal life goals.
