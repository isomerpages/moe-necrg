The Preventive Drug Education (PDE) Talk and Exhibition is conducted by experienced Narcotics Officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). This is an online resource that students and educators can explore and use for reference.

**Details**

The talk, injected with visually impactful slides, is customised in terms of the target audience to better relate the anti-drug messages to them. The talk is typically complemented with an exhibition (mobile bus, augmented reality markers or static panels) to facilitate audienceâ€™s internalisation of the anti-drug messages. 

*Talks are also available via virtual conferencing platforms.*

**Learning Objectives**

Students will learn and understand the harms of drugs and dire consequences of drug abuse.
