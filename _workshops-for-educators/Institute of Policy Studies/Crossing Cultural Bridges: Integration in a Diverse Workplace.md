<p>This workshop is part of the Institute of Policy Studies Programme on
Race, Religion and Intergroup Cohesion (IPS RRIC) and aims to equip educators
with the awareness, knowledge, and skills needed to address the dynamic
challenges of a diverse workforce and society and navigate sensitive situations
in a culturally competent manner. Amidst the vibrant tapestry of Singapore's
multicultural society, this workshop offers a transformative experience
that empowers educators to thrive in culturally diverse environments. Key
activities include an eye-tracking activity to recognise unconscious biases,
a Virtual Reality experience to build empathy for different perspectives,
roleplay scenarios to practise intervention skills, and a perspective-taking
card game to deepen appreciation of diverse viewpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>The workshop consists of the following segments:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Discover Your Privilege and Biases: Participants engage in guided activities
to reflect on personal privilege and uncover unconscious biases. Through
an eye-tracking exercise, educators explore how unconscious biases can
influence attention and judgement in a diverse classroom setting. Participants
will also have the opportunity to use an immersive virtual reality experience
designed by IPS that allows participants to step into the lived experiences
of others and build empathy. Guided reflection helps educators translate
these insights to the classroom, strengthening their awareness of the emotions
and experiences that students from different backgrounds face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate with Cultural Intelligence: Participants are introduced to the
concept of cultural intelligence and why it is essential in diverse workplaces
and learning environments. Through an activity on unpacking differences
with our culture boxes, participants reflect on assumptions and learn how
cultural perspectives shape communication and behaviour. This equips educators
with strategies to navigate misunderstanding and communicate more effectively
across the different cultural backgrounds in the classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate Cultural Difference: Participants actively practise intervention
techniques through roleplay, learning and practising how to respond effectively
and confidently to incidents of bias or unfair treatment. Through a perspective-taking
card game “Maybe, Perhaps”, educators consider multiple viewpoints in various
classroom scenarios using structured perspective-taking steps. This helps
educators pause before judgement, recognise diverse viewpoints, and respond
more fairly and thoughtfully to students from different backgrounds.</p>
