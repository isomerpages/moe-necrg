Develop a multi-dimensional Singapore Story that includes voices and experiences from our students and discussions of Singapore’s contemporary realities through issues.

**What can we do?**

• Keep pace with emerging trends/issues that are relevant and impact our students

• Dedicate time for discussions on contemporary issues that are relevant to our students’ life experiences

• Provide a safe space for different perspectives to be shared and discussed

• Provide opportunities for students to form personal viewpoints after considering and understanding different perspectives
