Uncover the story behind Singapore’s remarkable transformation into one of the most liveable cities in Asia. Discover how, through strategic long-term planning, we guide Singapore’s physical development in a sustainable manner to achieve a quality living environment for the people.

Deep dive into our pertinent needs as a city-state and learn how we embrace innovative urban solutions to address challenges such as land and water scarcity. Through fascinating maps, models and multimedia interactive exhibits, get a glimpse into our past and plans for the future.

**Details**

Students are invited to self-explore the Singapore City Gallery, which features a 270-degree panoramic show about life in Singapore from dusk to dawn, where they will be introduced to the challenges of planning for land-scarce Singapore through multimedia interactive exhibits. Through a massive architectural model, students will discover how thoughtful urban design transformed Singapore’s skyline, and how the conservation of heritage buildings adds to making Singapore even more distinctive.   They will also gain valuable insights on how URA brings plans to reality through a long-term and integrated planning process.
