Facilitator-led guided tour of SCCC’s SINGAPO人 exhibition.

**Details**

What is “SINGAPO人” about the Chinese in Singapore? In this guided tour of Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre’s exhibition, “SINGAPO 人: Discovering Chinese Singaporean Culture”, our trained facilitators will lead students to explore what makes up Chinese Singaporean culture through daily life – local food, language, and festivals. Students will uncover the factors which influence the shaping of
culture and how this identity has evolved over time and continues to change today. Our exhibition is open from 10am to 8pm daily, except Mondays, when we are open from 2pm to 8pm. School groups may request to visit the exhibition earlier at 9am. A minimum of 20 students is required for such requests.

**Learning Objectives**

Participants will
* Learn about our distinctive Chinese Singaporean culture
* Experience a new way of learning out of the classroom
* Acquire critical thinking skills
* Be inspired to discover their identity, and the impact of their relationships and choices
