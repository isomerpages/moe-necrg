<h3>MHA and Inter-Religious Organisation Collaboration: Learning Journey to Harmony In Diversity Gallery</h3>
<p>The Harmony in Diversity Gallery provides an immersive and engaging platform
for participants to learn about Singapore’s religious diversity and harmony.
It comprises four galleries of exhibits, artefacts and interactive features
that demonstrate the centrality of religious harmony to Singapore’s development,
and the efforts required to build interfaith peace in a religiously diverse
society.</p>
<p>The gallery will highlight our religious diversity, help us to recognise
the importance of seeking common ground to build mutual respect and accommodation,
and emphasise the need to protect and expand our common spaces.</p>
<p>The visit to the gallery is also accompanied by a guided heritage trail,
Telok Ayer – A Picture of Diversity. Diversity comes alive as we go back
in time to relive Telok Ayer in the 1800s. Learn about how the various
immigrant communities from various races and religions interacted as well
as the tensions and misunderstandings that sparked off conflicts among
them.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>The visit comprises (1) a guided tour of the gallery and (2) a guided
walking heritage trail of the Telok Ayer Area (one of the Streets of Harmony).
We also have a seminar room where groups can hold/conduct breakout discussion/dialogue
sessions with participants</p>
