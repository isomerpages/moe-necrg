Everyone loves a birthday party! Come and celebrate WonderBot’s birthday at Children’s Museum Singapore.

Through this facilitated learning journey at the special exhibition galleries, pupils will discover the flora and fauna of Singapore and Southeast Asia and explore the ways different communities in Singapore celebrate birthdays.

**Details**

Meet our friends, Ang Ku Kueh and Kueh Dadar! Attend a party with them at our Happy Birthday gallery to enjoy some snacks from our local communities. From a snack that is shaped like a flattened spiral  to one that resembles a tortoise shell, pupils will feast their eyes on these traditional snacks.  After that, look out for our feathered friends at Imagine a Garden. You’ll learn about their unique features and even have a chance to listen to their calls! Do stop and smell our National Flower, Vanda Miss Joaquim. It was created 130 years ago from a hybrid of 2 orchids!  A discovery kit will be provided to complement pupils' learning in the museum and they can redeem a token upon completion.
