Dear fellow educators,

Over the past two years, out-of-school programmes and activities have been necessarily muted. We hope that with the resumption of
programmes and activities, the 2023 edition of the guide will support you to design enriching NE learning experiences that will allow our students to interact with the community and inspire them to be active and concerned citizens.

While most of these programmes are in-person, some of the partners still offer a virtual or hybrid format for learning. This highlights the best of what we hope to achieve – leaning into the affordances of technology while recognising the importance of in-person connection and interaction with the community.

We hope this e-guide will support you in the important work that you do. It will showcase relevant resources, workshops and NE-related Learning Journeys from our partners, for both educators and students.

**What’s new**:

• Overview of NE

• Links to OPAL 2.0 microsite

We hope that the NE Community Resource Guide (NECRG) will aid you in your efforts to explore resources and consider how you could approach NE differently to inspire both staff and students. As you and your students engage with these learning experiences, we hope you discover for yourselves what Singapore and being Singaporean truly means to you
