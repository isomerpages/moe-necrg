# Junior Civil Defence (CD) Lionhearter Programme
The Junior Civil Defence (CD) Lionhearter Programme is an ambassadorial programme where upper primary students with leadership qualities are selected to serve as young Emergency Preparedness (EP) ambassadors, to invoke and spread the message on the importance of EP.

The Junior CD Lionhearters will be equipped with EP-related skills such as basic first aid, CPR-AED awareness, Ready Bag Concept, fire safety, fire hazards identification skills and SGSecure knowledge by undergoing a hard skills training session conducted by SCDF.
