schools are required to participate in all 3 programmes under TAP. Upon
completion of all three programmes, schools may include this initiative
as part of their submission for the School Green Awards by the Singapore
Environment Council. Top performing schools in reducing car trips will
also be recognised with a special achievement award.</p>
