<p>This workshop is part of the Institute of Policy Studies Programme on
Race, Religion and Intergroup Cohesion (IPS RRIC), designed to deepen mutual
understanding across different cultures and faiths through gamified activities
and facilitated discussions. Participants will explore insights into various
religions and build meaningful connections across differences. Built on
IPS’ own research, the workshop offers interactive, hands-on learning experiences
that help students develop empathy, curiosity, and confidence in engaging
respectfully with diverse beliefs and practices. Through a combination
of games and exchanges, the programme encourages students to reflect on
their own identities while also discovering shared human values that connect
different faiths.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>The workshop consists of the following segments:</p>
<p>1. Religious Literacy Quiz: This segment features a dynamic and fast-paced
quiz to enhance students’ knowledge of various religions. Through interactive
gameplay, participants foster greater awareness and understanding of different
faiths in an engaging and accessible format.</p>
<p>2. Culture Box Activity: This facilitated segment invites participants
to bring and share an item that holds personal significance from their
religion or culture. Each participant will have the opportunity to explain
the meaning behind their item—such as why it matters to them and how it
connects to their identity or lived experience. Through facilitated dialogue,
they are encouraged to engage with one another’s stories, ask questions,
and reflect on shared values and differences in a safe and inclusive space.</p>
<p>3. Values U Know Card Game: This segment features an interactive card
game that invites students to explore values drawn from various religious
traditions. Through meaningful discussion and personal reflection, students
engage with diverse perspectives in a thoughtful and accessible format.</p>
