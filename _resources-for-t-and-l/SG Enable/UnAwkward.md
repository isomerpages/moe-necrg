The “UnAwkward” campaign turns the tables and spotlights the “invisible disability” of awkwardness that impedes us from having meaningful interactions and conversations with persons with disabilities. Through humour, the campaign hopes to have people with and without disabilities share their own awkward experiences, normalise the feeling, learn how to UnAwkward themselves, and encourage more people to take the first step in getting to know persons with disabilities.

**Details**

The “UnAwkward” campaign comprises an 80-second video, 3 key visuals, and a pledge, which encourages students to UnAwkward themselves and take the first step in getting to know persons with disabilities. Teachers can use materials from the UnAwkward campaign to raise awareness on disability inclusion in schools.
