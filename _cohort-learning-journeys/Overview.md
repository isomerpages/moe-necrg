**Cohort Learning Journeys (LJs)** have been developed to provide all students with opportunities to explore their Singaporean identity through the arts, cultures and heritage. These complement our national Art, Character and Citizenship Education, Social Studies and History curricula.

Cohort Ljs consist of the Primary 5 NE Show, Museum-Based Learning (MBL) and Performing Arts-Based Learning (PABL) experiences.
