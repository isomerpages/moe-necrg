The MOM School Partnership Programme seeks to provide your students with informed perspectives of our migrant workforce by (i) raising their awareness on key issues involving our migrant workforce including policy considerations, (ii) building their appreciation for our migrant workers, and (iii) encouraging action in partnership with MOM on areas of interest. This in turn would equip your students with civic values and social-emotional competencies – such as appreciation of diversity, cultural sensitivity and empathy, in developing their social awareness to understand the perspectives and needs of people with different backgrounds or cultures.

**Details**

Assembly talks helps students attain contextual knowledge on our migrant workforce landscape and support systems put in place by the government to care for our migrant workers. Our speakers from MOM will share a broad overview on the strategies and measures that the government has put in place today as we safeguard our migrant workers safety and well-being.   Values In Action (VIA) opportunities provide opportunity to partner MOM in planning and executing VIA initiatives.
