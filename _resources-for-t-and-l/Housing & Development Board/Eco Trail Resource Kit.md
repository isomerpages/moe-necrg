The Eco Trails bring you around eco-destinations to explore the many green innovations that support eco-friendly high-rise living. Presently, there are two trails â€“ Explorer Trail and Voyager Trail.

To support schools in conducting self-guided Eco Trails, the Eco Trail Resource Kit has been developed as a self-help resource for educators to organise Eco Trails on their own, or train students in becoming eco-guides who will then organise the trails for their peers and the community.

**Details**

The Eco Trail Resource Kit helps educators prepare students to take on the role as Eco Guides and organise Eco Trails on their own.
The Resource Kit available for Primary and Secondary levels and includes:
* Training Materials for Educators (PowerPoint Slides and Training Notes)
* Materials for Eco Guides (Handbook for Eco Guides)
* Worksheets for Participants

**Learning Objectives**

Students will be able to gain a better understanding on the transformation of Punggol and the efforts that have been put in place to enable eco-living, thereby inspiring them to do their part for the environment and adopting an eco-friendly lifestyle. Additionally, students are empowered to take on the leading role in the trails as eco guides, allowing them to acquire leadership and public speaking
skills through the resources (i.e. handbook and slides) as they lead their peers and the community in the trails.
