<h4><strong>Organised by Defence Collective Singapore (DCS), in partnership with Nexus</strong></h4>
<p>N.E.mation! 2027 is Singapore’s national digital animation competition
that invites youths to express their perspectives on Total Defence through
creative digital storytelling. As Singapore prepares to undertake its role
in supporting the nation’s ASEAN Chairmanship, this edition also encourages
students to consider how individual acts of responsibility and resilience
contribute to both national security and broader regional cooperation.</p>
<p>From 2026 onwards, N.E.mation! evolves further by integrating Generative
AI tools into the storytelling process. Through a series of hands-on workshops,
students will learn how to leverage AI ethically and effectively in storytelling,
animation and content creation. The competition emphasises AI competency,
digital integrity, and responsible use of technology, reflecting the realities
of a fast-changing information landscape shaped by misinformation, deepfakes
and emerging cyber threats.</p>
<p>Designed for students with or without prior animation experience, N.E.mation!
2027 is an accessible and enriching learning journey.</p>

personal contributions to defence with ASEAN serving as the broader context.</p>
