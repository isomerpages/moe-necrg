### LEARNING JOURNEY TO INTERNAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT HERITAGE CENTRE

The ISD Heritage Centre chronicles past security operations that ISD has undertaken to keep Singapore safe and sovereign.    

Visitors will tour the Centre's galleries with exclusive displays of artefacts, photographs and rare documents to learn about key security incidents from Singapore's tumultuous past, as well as ISD's role in resolving them.

An example of this is how ISD uncovered the Jamaah Islamiyah (JI) plot to attack multiple targets in Singapore in late- 2001.  Among the Centre's exhibits is the actual car used by JI members to conduct reconnaissance on embassies they intended to attack.  

Visitors will also be updated on more recent security threats - such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - and better understand the danger terror groups continue to pose.
