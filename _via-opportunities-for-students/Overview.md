### VALUES IN ACTION (VIA)

Students are given an opportunity to choose and have a voice in what they believe will make a difference to the community. Being actively involved in learning about and appreciating the community develops
their sense of commitment in playing their part to make it a better place. Schools are encouraged to implement 4- or 6-year development plans to
ensure progressive, coherent and sustainable learning for students. As
students develop, the amount of teacher guidance should be reduced,
and student initiation and ownership should increase.
When students have greater ownership of their VIA experiences, they will
find it more meaningful and be more motivated to continue making a
difference, after graduation, to their community and nation.
