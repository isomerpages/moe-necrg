# GRANDFRIEND PROGRAMME
The Programme is the first-of-its-kind camp in Singapore that allows participants to experience living in a nursing home. It aims to promote intergenerational bonding and expose students to the myriad of career options in the Intermediate and Long-Term Care (ILTC) Sector. During the 3D2N camp, students would be paired to an elderly buddy, get a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes operations and speak to various staff working at the nursing home. To encourage experiential learning, participants stay overnight and sleep on hospital beds during the camp. The camp is typically conducted during the June and Dec school holidays. Since 2018, KWSH has conducted 4 runs of the camp.

> "My students have been involved in the inaugural Grandfriend Programme organized by KWSH in Dec 2018. The students had good feedback about the camp which has allowed them to understand the operations of nursing home in a deeper manner. They understood the challenges faced by nursing homes, healthcare workers and appreciated the myriad of issues faced by the healthcare industry in caring for our aging population. Our youths today will soon be part of
> the future workforce contributing to caring for our elderly population, this camp will give them a bigger perspective on the various stakeholders’ roles, challenging them to be part of the solutions in building a more inclusive society."
