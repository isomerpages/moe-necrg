<h3>Caring SG Commuters Committee: Public Transport Council and Land Transport Authority</h3>
<h4>Awareness Building Co-Creation Project</h4>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the planning and execution of an awareness-building co-creation
project, students will get opportunities to showcase their creative talents
and spread awareness on how to help vulnerable commuters on their public
transport journeys.</p>
<p>One example of this would be a series of short videos produced by students
from St. Andrew’s Junior College (SAJC), in which they highlighted practical
steps that caring commuters can take to assist vulnerable commuters (e.g.,
the visually impaired, seniors with dementia, or those with temporary physical
disabilities).</p>
<p>The videos may be viewed at the following links:</p>
