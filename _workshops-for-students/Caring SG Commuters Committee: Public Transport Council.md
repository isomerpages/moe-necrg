### Caring SG Commuters Movement: Why Should I Care’ Programme 

Commuting is an essential part of our day-to-day experience; it enables us to work, play and journey home at the end of each day. From conversations with our commuters, we know that the culture of care among them is important. The Caring SG Commuters Movement was thus started in August 2017 to foster a caring commuting culture in Singapore. The programmes enable commuters (e.g., students and educators) to have the opportunity to learn how to help one another and make commuting more inclusive and caring. 

**Details**

Students and educators participating in the ‘Why Should I Care’ Programme will get to hear from our partners on how commuters with different abilities navigate the public transport system, and also attend an experiential workshop. For example, Republic Polytechnic conducted ‘Project CompassioNATION’ for participants experience how commuting is like for commuters who face different challenges. The session can be tweaked based on the needs of the participants and level of participant involvement.

**Learning Objectives**

Both students and educators will be able to:
* Better understand the travel needs of different groups of commuters, for example seniors and persons with disabilities (PWDs), so that they can be more mindful and confident when offering help to them on the public transport.
* Develop greater empathy and situational awareness
