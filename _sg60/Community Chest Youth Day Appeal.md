<h3>Community Chest Youth Day Appeal</h3>
<p><strong>Name of Organisation: </strong>Community Chest</p>
<p><strong>Programme Type:</strong> Campaign</p>
<p><strong>Programme Details:</strong>
</p>
<p>As Singapore celebrates 60 years of progress, we look ahead to a future
where every dream can take flight. Since its inception in 1984, the Youth
Day Appeal has been a meaningful platform for students to embrace the spirit
of giving and grow into compassionate, community-minded individuals. This
year, as part of SG60, YDA continues to play an important role in rallying
our youth to give back and shape a caring, inclusive society for generations
to come.</p>
<p>Aligned with the Ministry of Education’s Values-in-Action Programme, this
initiative nurtures empathy, respect, and the belief that everyone—especially
those from communities in need—deserves the opportunity to thrive. In celebration
of SG60, all donations to YDA 2025 will be matched through the SG Gives
grant, amplifying students’ efforts and making each act of kindness go
even further. While schools commemorate a meaningful Youth Day, they are
also welcome to extend their fundraising period in conjunction with SG60
celebrations, contributing towards building a more caring and united Singapore.</p>
