### OneEarth Challenge
The programme uses gamification to encourage primary school students to travel to school by car-lite modes. OneEarth inculcates car-lite attitudes and behaviours among school children and can potentially help to alleviate congestion outside schools. Beyond the car-lite theme, LTA also partners with relevant environmental agencies to deliver a holistic environmental messaging to students.

**Details**

Every morning, students scan in their individual QR cards at iPad stations and earn energy for travelling by car-lite modes (walk/cycle/ride), and lesser energy for travelling by car. Students can then login to a virtual world to spend their energy to work towards individual, team, and school goals by interacting with car-lite themed quizzes and mini-games.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will learn the importance of car-lite travel, and how they each can play their part to care for the environment.
