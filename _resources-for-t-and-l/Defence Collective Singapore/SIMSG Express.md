<h3>Defence Collective Singapore</h3>
<h4>SIMSG Express</h4>
<p>Role-play as mayors of Singapore districts and immerse yourselves in this
game-based programme! Exercise good governance as you plan and build your
district - managing your limited land space effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will work in teams to play this game. Each round of the game
requires teams to collect and manage various resources to develop their
districts. As the gameplay reflects Singapore’s development over various
decades, teams must decide on the relevant infrastructure to construct,
to maximise the potential of their districts in that era. Teams must strategise
to avoid receiving penalties for water security issues. The team that manages
their resources most effectively wins the game.</p>
