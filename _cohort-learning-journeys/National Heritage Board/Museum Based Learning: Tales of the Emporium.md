Travel with us to the emporium of Geylang Serai and join our expedition to learn about the contributions of the Malay community! Students, playing the role of young explorers, will visit Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery and discover the rich
history of the area. They will also learn about leisure activities from yesteryear and the pasar (market) as a centre for food and goods for special occasions celebrated by the Malay and Muslim community.

**Details**

The learning journey will feature four stations located around Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery. Each station will feature activities and/or demonstrations that will engage the students in applying their field work skills, such as asking questions and gathering data through observation and stories.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will be guided to recognise the contributions made by the Malay and Muslim communities in the development of Singapore and understand the importance of knowing Singapore’s history and multicultural heritage, as well as the stories of the different people who came to Singapore to make up Singapore society, and the stories of our families.

> "My favourite object was the wedding money tray. What was the most interesting about it was that the flowers were made of 2 dollar notes. The folding
was really beautiful and realistic. It tells me that Geylang Serai is a common place for weddings, getting new clothes and many more."

> “ My favourite object was the gasing because it tells me about how the children in the past played. They played a lot of traditional games with their friends
and had so much fun. Nowadays, children only play video games because they don't realise that traditional games were so much fun and they can learn how to play them too."

Students were able to learn effectively with the
various stations."
