The MOM School Partnership Programme seeks to provide your students with informed perspectives of our migrant workforce by 
* (i) raising their awareness on key issues involving our migrant workforce including policy considerations, 
* (ii) building their appreciation for our migrant workers, and 
* (iii) encouraging action in partnership with MOM on areas of interest. This in turn would equip your students with civic values and social-emotional competencies – such as appreciation of diversity, cultural sensitivity and empathy, in developing their social awareness to understand the perspectives and needs of people with different backgrounds or cultures.

**Details**

Assembly talks help students attain contextual knowledge on our migrant workforce landscape and support systems put in place by the government to care for our migrant workers. Our speakers from MOM will share a broad overview on the strategies and measures that the government has put in place today as we safeguard our migrant workers safety and well-being.   Our Learning journeys provide opportunity for learning beyond the classroom as we promote active student interactions between students and our officers & migrant workers. Our officers work with schools to co-curate programmes and introduce students to places such as the Migrant Worker Onboard Centre, migrant worker dormitories, recreation centres and Our Migrant Workers Gallery.

Students will have a deeper understanding on migrant workforce issues, attain better insights on the livelihood of our migrant workforce in Singapore and develop empathy for our migrant workforce through dialogues and experiential learning.
