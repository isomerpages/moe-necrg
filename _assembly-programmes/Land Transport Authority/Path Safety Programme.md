Promotes safe and gracious path sharing practices at your school with LTA’s Path Safety Programme!

The Path Safety Programme comprises three modules:
•          A 25-minute assembly talk on safe path sharing;
•          A recess-time booth with interactive games; and
•          A 45-minute Confidence on Wheels session to learn best practices when riding an active mobility device (e.g. bicycle).

You can choose the module(s) that best suit your school’s needs, or organise all three modules for the complete experience. Self-help resources (in the form of slides and videos), adapted from the talk, are also available for school’s use.

**Details**

**Assembly Talk**: An LTA speaker will conduct the talk in the school hall, where short videos and quizzes will be used to engage the students.

**Recess-time Booth**: Engaging educational games on safe path sharing are offered at the recess time booth, where participating students have the chance to win prizes.

**Confidence on Wheels (CW) programme**: CW helps students understand how they should use our paths safely and graciously as active mobility device users and pedestrians.

Key components of the programme for primary schools include:

* Introduction to different types of active mobility devices, types of paths, and gracious path sharing behaviours
*
·       Familiarisation of infrastructure such as cycling paths, road crossings
·       Physical circuit where students learn how to apply path sharing behaviours when role playing as cyclists and pedestrians 

Key components of the programme for secondary schools include:

·       Introduction to different types of active mobility devices, cycling infrastructure, types of paths, active mobility rules and code of conduct

·       How to perform simple pre-ride bicycle checks

·       Raise awareness of students’ device handling skills through activity stations to help students ride more confidently

·       Discussions to help students learn how they can apply safe path sharing behaviours in common real-life scenarios

Self-help resources:

Teachers can use the self-help resources (slides and videos) during PE or CCE classes to educate students on the safe riding behaviours, as well as provide safety tips and habits that active mobility users and pedestrians should adopt when walking or riding on public paths.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will find out more on how pedestrians and active mobility device users can share public paths safely and graciously. They will gain a better understanding of active mobility rules, safety tips and habits that they can adopt when walking or riding on public paths.
