**Semakau Landfill**, the only landfill that habours human produced waste, has its lifespan
shortened every minute from the current rate of waste generation. In this guided tour, visitors
will understand the importance of waste minimisation, and how they could play a role in
achieving a sustainable living environment in Singapore.

**Incineration Plants:**
Tonnes of wastes are transported and incinerated at Incineration Plants daily. It is important for
everyone to understand the impact we will create to the environment, for every item that we
choose to dispose. In this guided tour, visitors will learn about the waste management system
in Singapore, and how to practice the 3Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle) as an effected way to reduce
the waste generation.

The programme will feature a short briefing before the tour of the facilities.
