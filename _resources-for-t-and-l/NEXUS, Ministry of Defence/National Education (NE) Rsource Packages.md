Total Defence, racial harmony, cyber-attacks at home and aboard, water security, terrorist attacks, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the reinstatement of National Service in some European countries, the threat of ISIS, and developments in the South China Sea. These are some examples of issues and developments that are of interest of Singapore or may have security implications for us. We call them
"NE moments".

Nexus develops packages with content on such "NE moments" for SAF Commanders use when they discuss current developments with their men. Nexus also shares these NE packages with other ministries and agencies. Teachers can use these NE packages to engage their students, when appropriate, as they provide an in-depth analysis on a variety of issues of national interest.

**Details**

Nexus develops resource packages on "NE moments" that are of interest to Singapore or may have security implications for us. For example, NE Package on Racial Harmony Day (Jul 2022), NE Insights on Disinformation and Influence Campaigns (Jun 2022), NE Insights on Our Energy Security (Jun 2022).

**Learning Objectives**

NE packages are developed to help SAF commanders and teachers understand issues, so they can engage their units or students on related discussions. NE packages can also be used by teachers as reference materials: for lessons on related topics for subjects such as Social Studies and General Paper; and for CCE lessons or events around the NE Commemorative Days.
