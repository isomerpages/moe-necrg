SG101 tells the stories of Singapore's journey as a nation, and through the stories, help Singaporeans understand what makes Singapore the country it is today and what makes us Singaporean.

**Details**

The content in SG101 is organised into four key categories -- "Defence and Security", "Economy", "Infrastructure", and "Society", each covering the following broad themes: Our fundamentals, national identity, and core values; Our enduring challenges and the new challenges that await us; What we did to succeed against the odds and what we need to progress together. SG101 also serves as a
repository for National Education resources, such as resource packages, videos, and ConnexionSG posts.

**Learning Objectives**

Teachers with an interest in the Singapore Story, especially those who teach History, Social Studies, and General Paper, can read SG101. SG101 can also be used as reference materials before teachers have discussions on related topics with their students.
