Through interactive drama, students will explore issues on: 
* CyberKindness 
* Neighbourliness 

These shows aspire to shine light on relevant contemporary issues in hope of sparking meaningful conversations among students. This will be done through recreating familiar scenarios or by introducing new settings within our local context to educate and differentiate the ‘normal’ from the right.

**Details** 

Students will be given opportunities to have a voice during these shows during hall-based live stage shows.

While exposed to social issues and its adverse effects online or in real life, students will identify and manage relevant situations, build resilience against negative behaviours and become encouraging and supportive individuals in their community and school.
