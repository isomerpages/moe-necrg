<h4>Connecting Faiths, Celebrating Cultures: Empowering Students Through Cultural &amp; Religious Literacy</h4>
<p>This workshop is part of the IPS Programme on Race, Religion and Intergroup
Cohesion (RRIC), aimed at promoting awareness, knowledge, and competence
in discussing, managing, and promoting race, religion, and intergroup cohesion
in our society.</p>
<p>Underpinned by years of cumulative research and grounded in policy relevance,
the programme leverages multidisciplinary perspectives to develop practical
tools, frameworks, and activities tailored for students—equipping them
to address intergroup tensions, foster constructive dialogue, and nurture
shared understanding in an increasingly complex and diverse social&nbsp;landscape.
In collaboration with MHA's Harmony in Diversity Gallery, the workshop
encourages students to reflect on their own cultural and religious identities
while developing sensitivity to the traditions and practices of others.
By identifying common values across different belief systems and learning
the fundamentals of intercultural communication, students will be equipped
to engage respectfully and effectively in diverse social settings. This
will help our students to build bridges of understanding, promote empathy,
and strengthen social cohesion in Singapore’s multicultural context.</p>

<p>The programme features a curated experience that includes a visit to the
