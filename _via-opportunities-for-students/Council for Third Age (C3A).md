### Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP)

The Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP) is an initiative by the Council for Third Age (C3A) and is part of the National Silver Academy (NSA). ILP aims to forge intergenerational solidarity between the young and the old to create a more cohesive and gracious society, promote active living, and enhance mental and social well-being among seniors.


**Details**

An ILP provides a unique experience of intergenerational interactions; where students and seniors can teach/learn from each other or learn/work together collaboratively. The topics offered can be digital readiness (e.g. computer skills or social media applications), handicraft work or even topics in which the schools specialise in (e.g. art and crafts, photography, culinary, and music). ILPs can be conducted in English/Mandarin/Malay/Tamil, as long as students can converse in it.

**Learning Objectives**

ILP serves as a “Values in Action” (VIA) programme as it fosters student ownership over how they can contribute to the community. Through the application of practical skills and knowledge, the students develop character and values. The students will also gain a deeper understanding of the elderly and develop skills such as empathy, patience, and respect for their elders through the experiences.

> Overall, it was a valuable learning experience for the students as they had the opportunity to host, interact, engage, and share their knowledge with the elderly. The efforts put into organizing this initiative and creating a platform for intergenerational interaction were much appreciated.
> 
> One aspect that stood out during this collaboration was the emphasis on making learning stick. By enabling students to connect, transfer, and apply their learning across different experiences, it created a truly comprehensive educational experience. This approach has immense value, as it allows students to recognize the practical value and impact of their learning in real-life contexts. The connection they make between theory and practice is an invaluable step in their overall development.
> 
> The opportunity for collaboration, both within the school community (VIA and ALP) and beyond, through Value in Action (VIA) projects is a particularly effective way to enhance the learning experience. Such collaborations foster teamwork, communication, and the sharing of ideas and resources, ultimately leading to more meaningful outcomes. By encouraging students to work together on these projects, we are equipping them with important skills that will benefit them in their future endeavours.
> 
> We would also like to highlight the significance of the students' encounters with demanding and impatient seniors. While these situations may have initially posed challenges, they ultimately became valuable learning opportunities. By navigating through such experiences, the students gained a deeper understanding of the elderly and developed important skills such as empathy, patience, and adaptability. It is through such encounters that students truly grasp the complexities of human interaction and learn how to effectively engage with diverse individuals.
> 
> To further enhance the learning experience, there was a proper pre-event lesson package, reflection and debriefing sessions conducted. These sessions provide students with a platform to be prepared and share their insights, challenges, and personal growth.
> 
> The school would like to express our appreciation for the organisers' commitment to creating a holistic learning experience for the students. By fostering collaboration, enabling practical application, and encouraging reflection, you have provided them with an opportunity to truly connect their learning with real-life situations. This approach is invaluable in shaping well-rounded individuals who can transfer their knowledge and skills across various contexts.
