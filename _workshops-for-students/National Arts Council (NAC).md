### Artist-In-School Scheme (AISS)

The Artist-In-School Scheme (AISS) supports sustained partnerships between Singapore arts professionals and schools, to co-develop customised arts experiences that deepen students’ engagement in and through the arts, to achieve one of the following objectives: - Deepen students’ understanding and appreciation of various art forms - Develop students’ awareness, skills and understanding of the non-performative aspects of the arts (e.g. Choreography, lighting and sound design, arts criticism) - Support broader educational outcomes by using the arts as a tool / methodology (e.g. Teaching Character and Citizenship Education through the Arts, working with traditional arts with artists to promote cross-cultural understanding)
