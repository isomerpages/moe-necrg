Biodiversity Week for Schools is a week-long event held annually in May, to commemorate the International Day for Biological Diversity. A series of exciting activities - Green Wave, BioBlitz for Schools, and Playtime series is lined up for students to learn more about the rich flora and fauna in Singapore.

**Details**

Biodiversity Week for Schools consists of 3 different activities:

1. Playtime series is a self-run programme to raise awareness of our natural heritage. This activity is suitable for Preschools and lower primary level. Through this activity, children will learn about our native flora and fauna through an interactive story book and animated video.

2. BioBlitz for Schools aims to document and identify and record as many species of wildlife within the school campus. By participating in this event, schools will be able to keep track of biodiversity in their premises and contribute to the school’s effort in greening its compound. This activity is suitable for students from upper primary and above to participate.
