Students explore issues on Cyber Kindness and Foreigner-Local Integration in the school context through interactive drama.

**Details**

Through interactive theatre-styled assembly drama, students will explore issues such as “CyberKindness” and “Foreigner-local integration”. The shows aspire to shine a light on these relevant contemporary issues in the hope of sparking meaningful conversations among students. Familiar scenarios will be recreated or introduced in new settings within our local context to educate students to
think critically and decisively when responding to undesirable behaviours and situations.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will develop critical thinking and decision-making skills when responding to undesirable behaviours and situations. They will also be given opportunities to have a voice during these shows, whether through online video conferencing or in-class live participation.
**Primary and secondary level shows are different to ensure age-appropriate content.*
