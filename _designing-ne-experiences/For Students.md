**Through CCE lessons** which provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students through explicit values-teaching and contemporary issues discussions

**Through Key Student Development Experiences** which contribute towards the holistic development of our students. These include:

* NE Commemorative Days 
* Values in Action
* Cohort Learning Journeys
* NRIC Presentation Ceremony (for Secondary)

**Across various subjects** such as Social Studies, History, Science, Music and Art – where learning of content knowledge also provides opportunities for exploration into national identity, contemporary issues, as well as Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities.

**Daily Routines** such as Everyday Responsibilities and the Flag-raising Ceremony are also infused with NE. Through Everyday Responsibilities, students develop a sense of responsibility and care for their own and shared spaces through daily cleaning and adopting sustainability practices in school and at home. During the Flag-raising Ceremony, our students sing the National Anthem and take the National Pledge to reinforce the values we stand for as a nation.

# How can we design meaningful NE learning experience for students?

Three Guiding Principles:

**Student-Centricity**

We place students at the heart of all our efforts in CCE. The essence of student-centricity is to seek to understand students’ needs and interests when designing learning experiences, focusing on student engagement and voice. This way, we empower them to derive personal meaning from their learning experiences.

**Intentionality**

We intentionally design and carry out CCE in and beyond the classroom, and do not leave learning to chance. We articulate the intended Learning Outcomes that develop the desired values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions in our students, and purposefully apply pedagogical approaches, and design learning experiences that are developmentally appropriate, engage students cognitively and affectively, and have an impact on their learning.

**Coherence**

The educational experience that we provide for our students needs to facilitate the development of character and citizenship dispositions, and social-emotional well-being, in a coherent way across the total curriculum. We leverage on multiple touchpoints such as the various aspects of CCE and also across subjects to enable students to connect, transfer, and apply their learning. Effective CCE implementation also requires conviction from all staff and building a common language within the school.
