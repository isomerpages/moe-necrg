<h4>Yours, Culturally</h4>
<p>As a Singaporean, we often take the rich culture of our country for granted.
Let's head back to these racial enclaves and recapture what makes Singapore
unique.</p>

<p>In this role-play driven programme, students will meet up with unique
characters at various historical districts to complete challenges that
are curated to test their understanding of the different facets of Singapore’s
cultures. The challenges are designed to not only encourage an understanding
of the different cultures in Singapore in terms of their unique food, festivals,
and traditional games, but also to foster teamwork, communication and collaborative
skills as teams work together to complete the challenges. Singapore Discovery
Centre is managed by Defence Collective Singapore.</p>
