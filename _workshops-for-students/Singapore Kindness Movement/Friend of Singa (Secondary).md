<h3>Friends of Singa Students’ Campaign Programme (Secondary)</h3>
<p>Introduced in 1990, the Friend of Singa (FOS) programme has evolved into
the Friends of Singa Students’ Campaign Programme (FOSSCP), empowering
students to take the lead in fostering kindness within their schools through
a 5-month campaign. In this programme, students are encouraged to identify
issues within their school community and implement meaningful solutions
that promote kindness. By the end of the campaign, our hope is that participants
will understand the vital role they play in making a positive difference. FOSSCP
seeks to empower and encourage all secondary school students to contribute
beyond themselves for the betterment of their surroundings (school, family
and community).</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will attend an interactive workshop at the end of February to
learn the basics of implementing a kindness campaign in school. The workshop
is optional. Students will also encounter experiential learning through
their process of completing their kindness project. Each school would be
able to receive funding of up to a total of $200 to kickstart their kindness
campaign(s).</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>At the end of the programme, students will be equipped with critical,
inventive thinking, project management and evaluation skills. As Friends
of Singa ambassadors, they will take ownership of their projects by doing
their part in tackling issues within the schools. </p>
<p>Upon completing their kindness projects, participating schools will be
recognized for their commitment to building a kinder nation and will be
awarded for their sustained participation in FOSSCP.</p>
<p>The Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) believes that by recognizing these
students, we can inspire a wave of kindness that will continue to grow
within schools and beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The students have gained invaluable experience in the process of brainstorming
for ideas, planning and executing the campaign”. – Secondary School Teacher
“Our student projects have fostered a deeper sense of empathy and social
responsibility among our students by encouraging them to take an active
role in improving their community. Through promoting kindness towards canteen
vendors, they learned to appreciate the hard work of those who are often
overlooked. The CyberKindness project heightened their awareness of the
impact of their actions online, making them more mindful of their digital
behaviour. Meanwhile, the initiative at Professor Brawn Café opened their
eyes to the challenges faced by disadvantaged individuals, inspiring them
to be more inclusive and compassionate. Overall, these initiatives have
shaped our students into more thoughtful and considerate members of society,
reinforcing the importance of kindness in both their immediate environment
and the broader community”. - Secondary School Teacher</p>
