Value In Action (VIA) @ HCA Day Hospice will give the students and teachers volunteers an opportunity to learn more about hospice care services available in Singapore. 

During the programme, students and teachers will be highly encourage to learn more about our patients, plan activities and games to engage our patients meaningful through a half-day or full-day activity. Groups who can commit to recurring volunteering will be encourage to do so for more meaningful engagement with our patients.
