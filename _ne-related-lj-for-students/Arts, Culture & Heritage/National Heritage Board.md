# "SEMANGAT YANG BARU: FORGING A NEW SINGAPORE SPIRIT" EXHIBITION

The "Semangat Yang Baru: Forging a New Singapore Spirit" Exhibition is co-presented by the Founders' Memorial and National Museum of Singapore, and will be held at the National Museum from 14 March to 17 September 2023. The exhibition presents stories that demonstrate Singapore's new spirit and founding values from the 1950s to 1970s when the fledging nation was being forged, and
makes links to contemporary developments to encourage contemplation on the relevance and interpretations of our values today. Stories explored in the exhibition will delve into the dilemmas and challenges faced by the people, especially Singapore's founding leaders, during the time of uncertainty, pluralism and ferment to flesh out the "new spirit" and values they embodied.

**Details**

Physical exhibition in the National Museum, accompanied by family resource (pre to lower primary children), and education resource for secondary school students. Education programme: "Scenario Room Programme" for secondary and post-secondary students. Resources will be provided for families with young children (pre & lower pri) and for secondary school students.

**Learning Objectives**

Through the exhibition, students will learn more about key milestones in Singapore’s nation-building history from the 1950s to 1970s and related contemporary developments. They will appreciate the difficult decisions and adaptations our people, especially the founding leaders, had to make, and be encouraged to reflect on Singapore’s founding values. The Scenario Room Programme will "transport" students back in time to role-play a character in an authentic local historical crisis, when difficult decisions had to be made, to encourage contemplation on our founding values.
