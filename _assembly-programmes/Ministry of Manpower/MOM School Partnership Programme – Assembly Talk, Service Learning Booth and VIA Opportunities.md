The MOM School Partnership Programme seeks to provide your students with informed perspectives of our migrant workforce by (i) raising their awareness on key issues involving our migrant workforce including policy considerations, (ii) building their appreciation for migrant workers and migrant domestic workers, and (iii) encouraging action in partnership with MOM on areas of interest. This in turn would equip your students with civic values and social-emotional competencies – such as appreciation of diversity, cultural sensitivity and empathy, in developing their social awareness to understand the perspectives and needs of people with different backgrounds or cultures.

**Details**

Organising assembly talks or service-learning booth in your school helps students attain contextual knowledge on our migrant workforce landscape and support systems put in place by the government to care for migrant workers and migrant domestic workers. Our speakers from MOM will share a broad overview on the strategies and measures that the government has put in place today as we safeguard our migrant workforce’s safety and well-being.

Values In Action (VIA) opportunities provide opportunities to partner MOM in planning and executing VIA initiatives. Students can either support MOM's existing initiatives to kickstart their Character and Citizenship Education competency development or initiate their own projects to further hone existing skills, fostering leadership and social responsibility at their own pace.

**Learning Objectives**

Through deeper engagement with Singapore's migrant workforce, students gain informed perspectives on key policy issues, build appreciation for Singapore’s migrant workers and migrant domestic workers, and develop essential civic values including cultural sensitivity, empathy, and global awareness. The programme hopes to align with Character and Citizenship Education objectives, offering real-world opportunities to understand diverse perspectives and needs.
