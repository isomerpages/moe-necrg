The Secondary 3 National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) Presentation Ceremony is a significant milestone in our studentsâ€™ National Education journey. It is an empowering citizenship experience that signals to students their coming of age as citizens of Singapore and accompanying roles and responsibilities.

**Through the NRIC Presentation Ceremony, students will:**
* recognise the importance of knowing what one's national identity means to oneself, and work towards the ideals and aspirations of one's nation embodied in one's National Anthem, Pledge and Flag.
* understand citizenship and one's privilege, rights, responsibilities and commitment with regards to one's future role as a voting member of society.

**Planning the Ceremony**
* Educators are encouraged to customise the NRIC Presentation Ceremony for their Secondary 3 students.
* The ceremony can be held on any suitable date following the receipt of students' NRICs from the MOE Portal Service. Educators may arrange for it to coincide with the NE Commemorative Days, such as National Day, or any other significant moment in the school year.
* Educators may involve students from other levels, alumni and/or school staff to help with the planning of the ceremony or to share personal stories on their role as a Singapore Citizen, thus encouraging the involvement of other stakeholders.

**Possible Format**
* Cohort-based ceremony (including a presentation of NRICs to class representatives)
* Class-based ceremony (including a presentation of NRICs by Form Teachers)
* Combination of cohort- and class-based experiences

**Possible Content**
* Citizens' rights and responsibilities
* Singapore's ideals - democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality
* History and function of NRICs
* Handling the NRIC with care

**Possible Activities**
