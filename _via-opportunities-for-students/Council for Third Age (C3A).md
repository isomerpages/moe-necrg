### Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP)

The Intergenerational Learning Programme (ILP) is an initiative by the Council for Third Age (C3A) and is part of the National Silver Academy (NSA). ILP aims to forge intergenerational solidarity between the young and the old to create a more cohesive and gracious society, promote active living, and enhance mental and social well-being among seniors.


**Details**

An ILP provides a unique experience of intergenerational interactions; where students and seniors can teach/learn from each other or learn/work together collaboratively. The topics offered can be digital readiness (e.g. computer skills or social media applications), handicraft work or even topics in which the schools specialise in (e.g. art and crafts, photography, culinary, and music). ILPs can be conducted in English/Mandarin/Malay/Tamil, as long as students can converse in it.

**Learning Objectives**

ILP serves as a “Values in Action” (VIA) programme as it fosters student ownership over how they can contribute to the community. Through the application of practical skills and knowledge, the students develop character and values. The students will also gain a deeper understanding of the elderly and develop skills such as empathy, patience, and respect for their elders through the experiences.



**Target Audience:** Primary 1- P6 students, Secondary 1- 4/5 students, Post Secondary (JC/ Poly/ ITE)

**Runtime:** All year round

**Fee:** Complimentary

**Modality:**  In-person, Virtual, Hybrid

**Duration of session:**  Each ILP could range from a minimum of 3 hours, held over 1 to 4 sessions. The duration of each session in the programme is up to the arrangement of the school (e.g. 3 hours over 1 session, 4 hours over 2 sessions, etc.). In addition, students will undergo 1 hour of soft skills training before the programme to equip them with the knowledge of the ageing process, and the communication skills necessary for intergenerational interaction.
