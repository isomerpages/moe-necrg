# LEARNING JOURNEY TO SEMAKAU LANDFILL AND INCINERATION PLANTS

Semakau Landfill, Singapore's only landfill that to contain human produced waste, has its lifespan shortened every minute from the waste generated. In this guided tour, visitors will understand the importance of waste minimisation, and how they could play a role in achieving a sustainable living environment in Singapore.

Incineration Plants

Tonnes of waste are transported and incinerated at Incineration Plants daily. It is important for everyone to understand the impact we will create to the environment, for every item that we choose to dispose. In this guided tour, visitors will learn about the waste management system in Singapore, and how to practice the 3Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle) as an effective way to reduce waste generation.
