The Artist-In-School Scheme (AISS) supports sustained partnerships between Singapore arts professionals and schools, to co-develop customised arts experiences that deepen students’ engagement in and through the arts, to achieve one of the following objectives: 
* Deepen students’ understanding and appreciation of various art forms 
* Develop students’ awareness, skills and understanding of the non-performative aspects of the arts (e.g. Choreography, lighting and sound design, arts criticism)
* Support broader educational outcomes by using the arts as a tool / methodology (e.g. Teaching Character and Citizenship Education through the Arts, working with traditional arts with artists to promote cross-cultural understanding)

**Details**

AISS provides an opportunity for schools to partner with artist(s) to provide customised arts experiences for students. It typically takes the format of workshops conducted by artists for students, with a recommendation of a minimum 10-hours artist-student interaction. Schools may work towards a presentation/showcase as a culmination of the partnership, as well as include a teacher-training component as part of the programme, on condition that the number of hours designated for teacher-training does not exceed the number of hours of artist-student interaction.

**Learning Objectives**

Through customised arts experiences that deepen students’ engagement in and through the arts, students will:

a. Develop art-form specific skills 

b. Achieve broader educational outcomes by using the arts as a tool / methodology (e.g. Teaching Character and Citizenship Education through the Arts) 

It is also hoped that students’ interactions with professional artists and arts groups will expose them to a range of arts experiences that seek to strengthen their sense of National Identity and foster deeper understanding of their Shared Heritage.
