Located at the Supreme Court, the Judicial Heritage Gallery provides students an immersive and experiential journey. The gallery takes students through the journey of how the Singapore Judiciary has developed in tandem with Singaporeâ€™s social history. Through the eyes of "Emily", a school going child, the students catch glimpses of the three branches of government, the development of Singapore's legal history pre-Independence and post-Independence, cases which leap out from different moments of Singapore's social history, judges' wigs and robes and other interesting artefacts from Singapore's judicial heritage. Students will also be invited to reimagine the courtroom of the future, putting creative expression on interactive walls resembling a futuristic page.

The Supreme Court Judicial Heritage Gallery was launched by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon at the Opening of the Legal Year 2020.
