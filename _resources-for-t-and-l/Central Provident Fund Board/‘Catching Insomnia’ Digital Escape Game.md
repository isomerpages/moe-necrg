As part of NE efforts to instil national identity and the spirit of togetherness in the young, the CPF topic is introduced in the curriculum to seed early appreciation and understanding of the role it plays in Singapore and the importance of active saving to meet key needs in life. 

Using an immersive storytelling approach to shed light on the intricate link between sleep, emotions and financial decisions in the metaverse, ‘Catching Insomnia’ aims to impel youths to make smart decisions with their money and life, not emotional ones. With an intriguing fantasy plot, a plethora of puzzles, mind-boggling clues and nerve-wrecking time limit, this game guarantees a learning experience like no other!

**Details**

This programme is made up of four game seasons, which will run from April 2023 to March 2025. Each game season comprises of a few qualifying rounds and a seasonal tournament. 

*Note: Youths only need to participate in one qualifying round for a chance to compete at the seasonal tournament.*


**Learning Objectives**

**Qualifying Round (Up to 2h)** 
The game will be played on an open-sourced platform, Gather, which offers a one-stop solution for dynamic game play via metaverse where: 
* Players can interact with one another via game avatars in the virtual world and at the same time, see and communicate in-person via video conferencing; 
* Explore a virtual exhibition with resources from valued partners such as Ministry of Education (MOE), MoneySense, National Library Board (NLB), and National Youth Council (NYC); and
* Solve game puzzles that are broadly related to these key CPF and financial literacy concepts. 
	* Don’t YOLO. Plan, because you only live once
	* Don’t give in to all temptations + Spending within one’s means 
	* Start early to leverage the power of compounding 
	* Make informed decisions when taking risks (investment-related) 
	* Be adequately protected via insurance, don’t go overboard

At the end of the game, players will congregate at the Library (a debriefing room) which summarises and reinforces the key learnings. 

**Seasonal Tournament (Up to 1.5h)** 
All players from the qualifying rounds (be it whether they qualify to compete in the final game battle) will be invited to join the seasonal tournament which features: 
* A 40-min webinar on CPF 101 
* Final battle & virtual award ceremony for the winning teams

> The design of the game was very appealing, and the game mechanics are fun!

Student, Raffles Institution 


> The game consists of very interesting puzzles which are not often seen in new games. I like how the game was nicely developed with nice graphics. It felt really thought through. 

Student, Ngee Ann Polytechnic 

> As a teacher, I think CPF is going in the right direction. The game is innovative, informative and interactive. The youths really enjoyed it and understood the key messages.

> I was pleasantly surprised by the puzzles and even a month on, can still remember them vividly. The lesson on looking out for guidance from others early on so that it would pay off later, was etched vividly in my mind. Similarly, I hope that youths will take away valuable knowledge of CPF while young so that they can reap the rewards later.
