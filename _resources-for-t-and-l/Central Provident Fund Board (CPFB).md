# CPF Game On! Programme
**CPF Game On!** programme is a fun way to jumpstart your students’ financial journey. It uses gamification techniques to engage students in understanding the role of CPF in Singapore and to inculcate key financial literacy concepts such as
compound interest, delayed gratification, and good spending & saving habits from an early age. 

Students can download our mobile game app – Kickstart your
future with CPF, and experience how their financial decisions will have an impact on their future.

To complement the mobile game app, teachers will be provided with the necessary resources to help students learn more about CPF and financial literacy. The programme encourages interaction through the use of a companion tablet application and an interactive board game which offers students a more
in-depth experience.

**Details**

**CPF Game On!** programme can be incorporated as part of your lesson plans or complement school events such as Total Defence Day or Social Studies Week given that CPF comes under the Economic Pillar in Total Defence and is covered in the Social Studies syllabus. Some schools have structured their lesson such
that students will play the mobile game app for 15 minutes and end off with the workshop module and learning printable within the 1-hour lesson time to encourage deeper learning.

The gameplay requires students to make “life decisions” where they will eventually realise the importance of inculcating good financial habits at an early age.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will learn more about CPF and money management concepts to kickstart their adulting journey via gamification techniques.
