<p>Facilitator-led guided tour of SCCC’s SINGAPO人 exhibition followed by
hands-on activity.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>What is “SINGAPO人” about the Chinese in Singapore? In this guided tour
of Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre’s exhibition, “SINGAPO人: Discovering
Singapore Chinese Culture”, our trained facilitators will lead students
to explore what makes up Singapore Chinese culture through daily life –
common food, language, and festivals. Students will uncover the factors
which influence the shaping of culture and how this identity has evolved
over time and continues to change today. Complete the guided tour with
a hands-on segment where students can express their creativity and originality
through a range of activities from craft and art making, to music making
and song writing. Our exhibition is open from 10am to 8pm daily, except
Mondays, when we are open from 2pm to 8pm.</p>
