<h3>Museum-based Learning: Artefactually Speaking at the National Museum</h3>
<p>In this artefact-centric programme, co-developed with the Ministry of
Education, students will explore the National Museum's galleries in independent
groups while guided by a Passport activity booklet. They will also get
to discover fascinating stories about specific artefacts from Singapore’s
700 years of history as they interact with our Museum Educators.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>This facilitated programme empowers students to independently explore
the galleries, while looking for Museum Educators who will share stories
and converse with them about the museum's artefacts and Singapore's past.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives: </strong>Students will understand how different
