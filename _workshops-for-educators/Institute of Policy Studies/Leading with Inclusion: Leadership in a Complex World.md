<p>This workshop is part of the Institute of Policy Studies Programme on
Race, Religion and Intergroup Cohesion (IPS RRIC) and aims to equip educators
with the knowledge, skills, and frameworks to foster a more collaborative
and effective organisational environment. By the end of the session, leaders
will be able to develop an understanding of inclusive leadership, gain
an understanding of unconscious bias and its influence on judgement and
decision-making, gain an understanding of how Inclusive Leadership can
enhance leadership effectiveness and organisational culture, and learn
frameworks to create an inclusive environment where all team members feel
valued and respected. Key activities include an Inclusive Leadership self-diagnostic
to understand individuals’ leadership behaviours, an Implicit Association
Test to discover unconscious biases, a Virtual Reality experience to build
empathy for different perspectives, and a facilitated group discussion
to translate inclusive leadership principles into practical action.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>The workshop consists of the following segments:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Introduction to Inclusive Leadership (Think, Feel, Do Framework): Participants
are introduced to the concept of inclusive leadership using the IPS Think,
Feel, Do framework. A self-assessment exercise allows participants to reflect
on their own leadership styles and gain awareness of how their behaviours
and assumptions influence others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discover Our Biases (Think): Participants complete an Implicit Association
Test (IAT) designed by Harvard and adapted by IPS. The activity surfaces
unconscious biases and sparks discussion on how such biases are formed,
how they influence judgement and decision-making, and how educators can
address them more mindfully in leadership and facilitation roles. Engage
in IPS Self-Diagnostic Tool to review how your leadership style ranks in
terms Awareness, Empathy and Willingness to Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building Empathy (Feel): Through a virtual reality experience designed
by IPS, participants step into the perspective of a minority colleague
navigating workplace microaggressions. The immersive experience helps build
emotional empathy by allowing educators to better understand the lived
experiences of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inclusive Action (Do): Participants apply key inclusive leadership strategies
in a facilitated discussion. Participants collaboratively reflect and brainstorm
what inclusive leadership looks like within their own organisations and
how they can translate insights into concrete actions.</p>
</li>
