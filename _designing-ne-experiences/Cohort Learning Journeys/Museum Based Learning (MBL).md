MBL (Art) and MBL (CCE, History and Social Studies) aim to enable a more inclusive and authentic learning experience for students in art, heritage and history
through pre-, during- and post-visit lessons to Singaporeâ€™s art museums and historical sites. As these LJs are designed to achieve respective syllabus outcomes, including the development of citizenship dispositions and national identity in students, it is necessary for students go through cohort LJs at the
designated academic level and in all three phases (i.e. pre-, during and post-learning journey). This will ensure appropriate sequencing and scaffolding of learning to help students process new learning, retain information and apply what they have learnt.

The pre-visit experience arouses students' interest, activates their prior knowledge and provides relevant context to allow students to form deeper and more meaningful connections to the new knowledge and experiences gained during the visit. The post-visit experience provides time and space for students to review, reflect and help them make connections between what they already know or have experienced within their lives and across the curriculum.

All the MBL experiences are facilitated by museum educators with expertise in content on both the galleries and artefacts at the respective sites.
