# THE NEWS GALLERY: BEYOND HEADLINES TOUR AND WORKSHOP

The News Gallery: Beyond Headlines is an exhibition at the National Library featuring Singapore's earliest newspaper collections and interactive stations. In this programme, students will be taken on a fun and interactive learning experience that combines a tour of exhibition and a workshop to pick up useful media and information literacy skills.

**Details**

This tour and workshop programme can be conducted either physically or digitally, where cohort-sized audiences can be accommodated. As Kahoot! will be utilised to engage the students in quizzes and activities, the usage of smartphones or Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) is recommended.

**Learning Objectives**

As part of The News Gallery’s school outreach programme, students will learn more about the rising trend of online misinformation and its impact on our society, along with applying NLB’s S.U.R.E. (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) steps to combat its spread. Students will also learn news literacy skills, recognize various forms of news biases and understand the different perspectives of articles. This programme ties in with Digital Defence, the sixth pillar of Total Defence, to guard against threats in the digital domain, hence building resilience to maintain social cohesion.
