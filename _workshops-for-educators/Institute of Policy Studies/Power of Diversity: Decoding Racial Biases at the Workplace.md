<p>This workshop is part of the Institute of Policy Studies Programme on
Race, Religion and Intergroup Cohesion (IPS RRIC) and aims to equip educators
with the awareness, knowledge, and skills needed to engage confidently
and constructively with issues of bias and insensitivity in multicultural
Singapore. Drawing on decades of IPS research in social cohesion, the programme
combines multidisciplinary insights with practical tools and activities
tailored for educators. Through interactive discussions and hands-on learning,
participants build confidence to recognise biases, approach sensitive conversations
with empathy, and take positive action in challenging situations. Key activities
include live polling to capture educator perspectives, the IPS H4IPS Racism
Meter to understand if 'this is racist?', and opportunities to practise
intervention skills in school settings, helping educators develop practical
skills, foster empathy, and promote inclusive, respectful communities.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>The workshop consists of the following segments:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Interactive Polling: Educators engage in real-time polls discussing everyday
scenarios to explore how bias and unfair treatment can range from obvious
to subtle forms, encouraging self-reflection and group dialogue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Racism Meter Activity: Using the H4IPS Racism Meter, educators assess
if a given scenario can be considered ‘racist’ or not. The activity helps
participants break down the loaded concept of what is ‘racism’ and how
insensitivities can be hurtful. Educators learn how to apply this lens
in real classroom situations to identify potential instances of racism,
make informed judgments, and intervene appropriately to support students
and foster an inclusive learning environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roleplay with interventions: Educators actively practice intervention
techniques through roleplay, learning and practising how to respond effectively
and confidently to incidents of bias or unfair treatment. The session closes
with sharing best practices for real-world application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
