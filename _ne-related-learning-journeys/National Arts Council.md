**Arts Education Programme (NAC-AEP)**

The National Arts Council – Arts Education Programme (NAC-AEP) provides all schools access to quality artist-led programmes to support and extend arts learning in classrooms and CCAs. The design and curation of programmes for NAC-AEP is guided by the new **NAC Arts Education Framework**, consisting of 3 Focus Areas and 5 Points of Emphasis. Programmes are available across various art forms including Dance, Music, Theatre, Literary Arts, Visual Arts & Digital Media, and are eligible for a 50% Tote Board Arts Grant subsidy capped at $15,000 per school per calendar year.

**Details**

In-School programmes will take the form of performances, talks and workshops. Out-of-School programmes will include excursions, guided visits, public performances or exhibitions by professional artists and arts groups.

**Learning Objectives**

Through interactions with professional artists and arts groups, students will be introduced to a range of arts experiences that strengthens their National Identity and develops a deep understanding of their Shared Heritage. TIP – Search for programmes under the Focu Area ‘APPRECIATE ARTS & CULTURE’ and/or look for ‘SG CULTURAL IDENTITY’ and ‘Life Skills’ as a Point of Emphasis!
