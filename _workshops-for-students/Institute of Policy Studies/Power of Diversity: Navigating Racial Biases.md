<p>This workshop is part of the Institute of Policy Studies Programme on
Race, Religion and Intergroup Cohesion (IPS RRIC) and aims to equip students
with the awareness, knowledge, and skills needed to engage confidently
and constructively with issues of bias and insensitivity in multicultural
Singapore. Drawing on decades of IPS research in social cohesion, the programme
combines multidisciplinary insights with practical tools and activities
tailored for students. Through interactive discussions and hands-on learning,
participants build confidence to recognize biases, approach sensitive conversations
with empathy, and take positive action in challenging situations. Key activities
include live polling to capture student perspectives, the IPS H4IPS Racism
Meter to understand if 'this is racist?', and opportunities to practice
intervention skills in person or in online environments, helping students
develop practical skills, foster empathy, and promote inclusive, respectful
communities.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>The workshop consists of the following segments:</p>
<p>1. Interactive Polling: Students engage in real-time polls discussing
everyday scenarios to explore how bias and unfair treatment can range from
obvious to subtle forms, encouraging self-reflection and group dialogue.</p>
<p>2. Racism Meter Activity: Using the H4IPS Racism Meter, students assess
if a given scenario can be consider ‘racist’ or not. The activity helps
participants breakdown the loaded concept of what is ‘racism’ and how insensitivities
can be hurtful.</p>
<p>3. Roleplay with interventions or Navigating Difficult Conversations Online
(Format flexible based on preference): Students actively practice intervention
techniques through roleplay or an online platform, learning and practising
how to respond effectively and confidently to incidents of bias or unfair
treatment. The session closes with sharing best practices for real-world
application.</p>
