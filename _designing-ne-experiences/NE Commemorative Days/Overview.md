##### **NE Commemorative Days**

National Education (NE) Commemorative Days are linked to defining moments in Singapore's history. Schools can customise learning activities and follow up with programmes to create holisticÂ learning experiences for our students.

##### **15 Feb - Total Defence Day (TDD)**
**Theme: Together We Keep Singapore Strong**

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February each year to mark the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, our students reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's best all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore(e.g. terrorism, pandemics,cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic crises). Students also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core message of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life. 

##### 3rd Friday of Term 2 - International Friendship Day (IFD)
**Theme: Singapore in Asia**

Schools commemorate International Friendship Day on the 3rd Friday of Term 2. This is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. The commemoration of IFD allows our students to be sensitised to Singapore's geopolitical realities, and to reflect on the importance of

* an active foreign policy to maintain Singapore's international space;
 
* openness to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent;

* cross-cultural skills and a global orientation; and

* the spirit of friendship and collaboration amongst different people.

##### 21 Jul - Racial Harmony Day (RHD)
**Theme: Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic**

Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on 21 July each year to mark the anniversary of the 1964 race riots. On this day, students reflect on and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures and the collaborative effort of all to promote social cohesion. 

##### 9 Aug - National Day (ND)
**Theme: to be confirmed closer to the date**

*Schools to commemorate National Day on 8 August 

National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence as an independent country in a community of nations. The school-based commemoration brings to students a sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day.
