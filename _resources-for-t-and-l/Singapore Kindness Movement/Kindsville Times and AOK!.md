Accompanying every Kindsville Times newsletter issue, a Singa and the Kindness Cubbies animation will be launched online. In the animation series, we see Singa and the Kindness Cubbies continue their mini adventures while learning how to be gracious and considerate citizens in Kindsville.

**Details**

Kindsville Times and A-OK! are newsletters that introduce a kindness topic to primary school students. The newsletters are available in age-appropriate versions: Kindsville Times Junior (Primary 1 and 2), Kindsville Times Adventures (Primary 3 and 4) and A-OK! (Primary 5 and 6). Kindsville Times will be accompanied by a 7-minute ‘Singa and the Kindness Cubbies’ animation episode, launched online.

**Learning Objectives**

Through simple activities, comics, kindness tips and contests, students will learn about the importance of specific character values and positive attitudes towards school-life challenges.
