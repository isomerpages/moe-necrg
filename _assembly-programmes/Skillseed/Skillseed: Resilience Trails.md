<h3>Skillseed</h3>
<h4>Resilience Trails</h4>
<p>Resilience Trails is Skillseed’s place-based, asset-driven and community-led
initiative that provides flexible, high wage and home-oriented work opportunities
to lower-income families, through the medium of paid community trails in
our Community Guides’ neighbourhoods. Beyond simply being a means to boost
the earnings of our Community Guides, the Resilience Trails further serve
as a platform that promotes the agency, voice and dignity of our Guides,
by drawing out their personal stories and strengths without downplaying
their challenges.</p>
<p>Participants who experience the trails gain deeper empathy, understanding
and appreciation of our vulnerable communities’ lived experiences. Finally,
the trails also placemake, as they highlight and connect the various community
assets, thus becoming a springboard for community collaboration and convening.</p>

<p>“My students said the lecture was truly inspiring and eye-opening. It
advances their knowledge and understanding of inequality in Singapore,
and provides incredibly valuable inputs for them to practise systems thinking
skills.” - Dr Cindy Fu, NUS</p>
