**Details**

Write for Kindness (WFK) is a national creative writing competition organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement, with the Singapore Book Council as programme partner. WFK is a platform for students to promote kindness to young children by creating age-appropriate and culturally relevant children’s stories through short stories, poems, songs and illustrations.
