<h3>SIGNATURE TOUR IN THE DARK</h3>
<p>For this experiential learning journey, participants walk through themed
rooms that simulate real life situations and environments – such as a park,
a busy street and a café – in complete darkness. As they explore in darkness,
they are challenged to rely on their other senses, collaborate and communicate
more clearly, develop empathy and better appreciate their sense of sight.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Led by a guide who is blind, participants will enter the themed rooms
in groups of up to eight for a guided tour. As they go through the rooms,
the guide will facilitate discussions on challenges that blind people face
on a daily basis, as well as conduct a short debrief at the end of the
tour.</p>
