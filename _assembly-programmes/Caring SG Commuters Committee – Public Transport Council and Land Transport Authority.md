### Caring SG Commuters Movement: Caring Commuter Assembly Talk

Commuting is an essential part of our day-to-day experience; it enables us to work, play and journey home at the end of each day. From conversations with our commuters, we know that the culture of care among them is important. The Caring SG Commuters Movement was thus started in August 2017 to foster a caring commuting culture in Singapore. The programmes enable commuters (e.g., students and educators) to have the opportunity to learn how to help one another and make commuting more inclusive and caring.

**Details**

The assembly talk broadly covers the origins of the Caring Commuter Champion programme (See ‘Caring SG Commuters Movement’ under ‘Values in Action (VIA) Opportunity’ for more information regarding this e-learning programme), the inclusive features and infrastructure on public transport, and how students can be a caring commuter. The talk is conducted by officers from the Caring SG Commuters Committee.  

**Learning Objectives**

Both students and educators will be able to:  
* Better understand the travel needs of different groups of commuters, for example seniors and persons with disabilities (PWDs), so that they can be more mindful and confident when offering help to them on the public transport. 
* Develop greater empathy and situational awareness
