The [National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) Presentation Ceremony](https://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/csl/s/cce-2021-main-sdcd/wiki/page/view?title=NRIC+Presentation+Ceremony-+beta) at Secondary 3 is a significant milestone in our studentsâ€™ National Education journey. It is an empowering citizenship experience that signals to students their coming of age as citizens of Singapore and accompanying roles and responsibilities.
