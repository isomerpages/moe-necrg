Design learning experiences that allow students to exercise ownership of the community, build stronger relationships with their peers in an increasingly diverse society, and initiate ways to contribute to the nation in order to nurture a commitment to take action.

**What can we do?**

• Design experiences that will provide immersive settings and hands-on opportunities for students to own and apply their learning

• Work with community partners to enhance learning experiences students

• Tailor programmes and experiences to students’ unique needs
