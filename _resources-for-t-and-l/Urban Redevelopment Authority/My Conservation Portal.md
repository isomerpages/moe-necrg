My Conservation Portal is an online gateway to information on Singapore’s built heritage. Students can locate our historical districts and conserved buildings using the online map resource. This would guide them to learn more about the history and architecture of the conserved buildings and districts. This is an online resource that students and educators can explore and use for reference.

**Details**

My Conservation Portal is an online resource that can be accessed by educators, parents and students at any time to find out about our conserved built heritage.

**Learning Objectives**

Students and educators will be able to use the Conservation Portal for online research on conserved buildings, structures and historical areas across Singapore. Besides write-ups on the history of conserved buildings, places and structures, this resource features photographs and plans from URA’s rich archives. This would help students to develop analytical and research skills. At the same time, it would also help them gain an understanding of conservation and planning principles that shape Singapore as a city and nation.
