### Student Archivist Project 2024

SAP is an oral history project organised by the Founders' Memorial and National Museum of Singapore (NMS) in which student interviewers collect personal stories from senior interviewees about specific themes such as housing, public health policies etc. Student participants will be trained in oral history interview methodology before they plan and conduct their own oral history interview with senior interviewees aged 60 and above. Through the project, students stand to gain a better understanding of the past through the lenses of first-hand witnesses, and practise intergenerational communication skills and collaborative skills with their team mates. 

SAP provides students with the rare opportunity of contributing research and content to NMS, and the upcoming Founders’ Memorial (FM) at Gardens Bay East, which honours the values and ideals demonstrated by Singapore’s founding generation of leaders as they faced dilemmas and undertook difficult decisions to ensure the country’s survival in its fledging years.

**Details**
		
SAP will take place over 6-7months, with a call for application in Jan, an oral interview skill workshop, and dateline for submission at the end. After looking through the submissions, selected schools will be invited to conduct a video interview that the Founders' Memorial will showcase in our upcoming exhibitions.
