**Teacher Empowerment for Transforming Practice**

Educators play a key role in developing our students’ citizenship dispositions. We too must explore our own values and beliefs about citizenship.

How can we better support our fellow educators on this NE journey? As CCE teachers, we must understand, believe in and practise the dispositions, values and social-emotional competencies that we hope to impart to our students. It is crucial that the messages that students receive are consistently and coherently demonstrated in the various experiences that they encounter throughout the school day.

**Platforms for Professional Development**

As teachers, we are dedicated to helping our students grow through developing values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions. Reflecting on our actions and personal experiences allows us to construct meaning and gain insights that could help enhance our students’ learning experience. We can start by identifying and developing the competencies needed to teach CCE well.
