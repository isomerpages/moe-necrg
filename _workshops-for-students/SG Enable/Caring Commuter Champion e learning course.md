Caring Commuter Champions are volunteers who would like to step up and show care to those in need during their daily commute on public transport. The Caring Commuter Champion e-learning course is developed by the Caring SG Commuters Committee in partnership with SG Enable. The 2-hour e-learning course comprises of 9 modules which will equip students with skills to assist special groups of commuters (e.g. commuters with visual impairment, commuters with physical disabilities). Students will learn about the various disabilities and conditions, mobility aids and assistive tools that are available, and how assistance can be rendered appropriately. Upon successful completion of the training session, students will be recognised as certified Champions and will be awarded an e-certificate.
