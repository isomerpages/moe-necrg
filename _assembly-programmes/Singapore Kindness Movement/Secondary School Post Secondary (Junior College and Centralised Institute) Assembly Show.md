Students explore issues of Cyber Kindness and Neighbourliness in the school context through interactive drama.

**Details**

Through interactive drama, students will explore issues on:
* CyberKindness
* Neighbourliness

These shows aspire to shine light on the relevant contemporary issues in hope of sparking meaningful conversations among students. This will be done through recreating familiar scenarios or by introducing new settings within our local context to educate and differentiate the ‘normal’ from the right. 

Students will be given opportunities to have a voice during these shows, whether through
class-based online video conferencing, in-class human facilitation or hall-based live stage shows.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will develop critical thinking and decision-making skills when responding to undesirable behaviours and situations. While exposed to social issues and its adverse effects online or in real life, students will identify and manage relevant situations, build resilience against negative behaviours and become encouraging and supportive individuals in their community and school.
