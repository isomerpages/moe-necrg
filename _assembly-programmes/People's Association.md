# Chingay National Education Programme

PA started Chingay NE Assembly Programme and Show in 2013 to introduce Chingay Parade to students. Since 2013, the NE Assembly Programme and Show has become an annual feature of Chingay Parade. It introduces and inculcates important values which are key to nation-building through creative, engaging and
interactive activities. Through this programme, it hopes to enable the students to understand the meaning behind Chingay and to appreciate the multi-culturalism of Singapore. This programme also provides a platform for students to showcase their co-creations.

**Details**
The programme will either be conducted in assembly halls in schools or virtually on online meeting platform. A facilitator will bring the students through the programme through story-telling format and the students will also be engaged in some interactive activities like quizzes and demonstration.

**Learning Objectives**
Students will learn the origin of Chingay Parade and how Chingay highlights the multi-cultural aspect of Singapore. Students will also learn to appreciate how people of Singapore come together to put up Chingay Parade and understand how they can also contribute and be engaged to be part of this event.

> Presentation was very well planned and instruction were clear and timely. The programme was very well received by the students. The students loved the interactive activity because it was fun, easy to follow, and allowed all students
to participate. We look forwards for next yearâ€™s programme and will recommend it to other schools.

Thank you for highlighting the importance of coming together as a community and igniting our passions as we journey forward! Will definitely recommend this programme to other schools.
