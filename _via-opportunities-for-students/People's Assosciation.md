> The Service-Learning Champion Programme enabled our students to link up with beneficiaries and events in the constituency, allowing them to plan for activities and address real needs of the communities. Students also received constructive feedback from Limbang Youth Network which was valuable in helping them learn how to adapt and solve problems.
