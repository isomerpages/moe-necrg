### Responsible Pet Ownership

Through our educational programmes, students will learn about how they can contribute to a sustainable urban ecosystem where humans and animals live in harmony.

**Details**

Students will learn what it takes to be a good pet owner and why only certain types of animals should be kept as pets. They will also get to observe a demonstration of cleaning, feeding and grooming for various pet animals, and understand the importance of caring for a pet collectively as a household. For the Learning Journey at Jacob Ballas Children Garden, students will visit the animal classroom and meet the animal ambassadors that are currently in AVS’ care. For the Show & Tell, AVS staff will visit schools with our animal ambassadors.
