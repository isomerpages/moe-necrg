> "Spending time at HCA was an enriching and interesting experience. It exposed me to the world of hospice care and made me more educated on the aspect. Also, designing the carnival games with my friends made me get in touch with my arts and crafts skills, as well as learn more about coordination and communication within a group" 

-Koh Zheng Yan, J2 student (Hwa Chong Institute)

> "One word I would use to describe my trip to the hospice care today is enriching. Being able to communicate and interact with them, being there to help them when they need it, playing mahjong with them and listening to their wise words and thoughts; was really my utmost joy. It breaks my heart knowing that those elderly are on their final journey of life, and I feel that we as the younger generation should step out more to do volunteering work for them, to give them the best final days they have. I initially thought that a hospice would be like a old folks' home; where there are just hospital beds and nurses helping around. Instead, it was totally different. You can still see elderly walking about, in wheelchairs but you can tell that they are still happy. It breaks my heart to see this, but this is how the world is. Overall, really took away some learning pointers like playing mahjong even better, life stories and wise words from the uncles and aunties and just the fun we have with them."
