'Cerita' (Stories) highlights the everyday life, customs and traditions of the Malays. It was the last exhibition presented at the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC) before it was closed and features some of the Centre’s key artefacts that were displayed from the last decade. The virtual exhibition provides an opportunity for students to revisit the exhibition or explore it if they had missed it when it was presented at MHC.
