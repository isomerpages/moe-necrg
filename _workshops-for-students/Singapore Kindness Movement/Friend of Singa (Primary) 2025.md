<h3>Friends of Singa Students’ Campaign Programme (Primary)</h3>
<p>Introduced in 1990, the Friend of Singa (FOS) programme has evolved into
the Friends of Singa Students’ Campaign Programme (FOSSCP), empowering
students to take the lead in fostering kindness within their schools through
a 5-month campaign.</p>
<p>In this programme, students are encouraged to identify issues within their
school community and implement meaningful solutions that promote kindness.</p>
<p>By the end of the campaign, our hope is that participants will understand
the vital role they play in making a positive difference. FOSSCP seeks
to empower and encourage all secondary school students to contribute beyond
themselves for the betterment of their surroundings (school, family and
community).</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will attend an interactive workshop at the end of February 2025
to learn the basics of implementing a kindness campaign in school. The
workshop is optional.</p>
<p>Students will also encounter experiential learning through their process
of completing their kindness project. Each school would be able to receive
funding of up to a total of $200 to kickstart their kindness campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>At the end of the programme, students will be equipped with critical,
inventive thinking, project management and surveying skills. As Ambassadors
of Kindness, they will take ownership of their projects by doing their
part in tackling issues within the schools and/or community.</p>

<p>“Thank you for providing us with this wonderful opportunity to teach our
children about kindness. Through this campaign, our students have learned
valuable lessons about empathy, compassion, and the importance of treating
others with respect. Whether it is practicing CyberKindness online or showing
kindness in real life, these lessons are crucial for their personal development
and for fostering a positive and inclusive environment.  We are grateful
for the positive impact this programme has had on our students and look
forward to continuing our partnership in the future.” – Primary School
