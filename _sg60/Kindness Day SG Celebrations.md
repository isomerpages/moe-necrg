<h3>Kindness Day SG Celebrations</h3>
<p><strong>Name of Organisation: </strong>Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM)</p>
<p><strong>Programme Type:</strong> Campaign</p>
<p><strong>Programme Details:</strong>
</p>
<p>To celebrate Kindness Day SG, SKM has prepared an <u>Appreciation Card activity</u> within
Kindsville Times/A-OK! Issue 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students can pen their appreciation
for their family / school staff / people in our community (e.g., frontline
workers, bus captains) and show care.&nbsp; Schools are encouraged to conduct
the Appreciation Card activity by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Riding on school’s existing programme (e.g., Gratitude Week) which may
not be in May; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carrying it out as a school-wide VIA in May, in line with Kindness Day
SG on 23 May 2025.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools can also encourage students to participate in the <em>Write to Singa</em> activity,
or join the KDSG Drawing Contest as part of the celebration.&nbsp; More
information about these two activities can be found in Issue 2.</p>
<p>SKM would like to appeal for schools’ support to post celebrations of
Kindness Day SG on schools’ social media, and use <u>#KindnessDaySG</u>,
along with <u>#WeAreGratefulSG</u>, and <u>tag @kindnessSG</u> to share how
students are spreading kindness.</p>
