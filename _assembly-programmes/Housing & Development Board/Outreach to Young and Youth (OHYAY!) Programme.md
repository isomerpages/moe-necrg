HDB’s OHYAY! programme seeks to raise awareness on good neighbourly messages and to nurture students in building active and caring communities in the heartlands. Students will attend a digital roadshow and will be encouraged to complete an e-learning module as part of post-roadshow engagement which helps reinforce the key messages learnt.

**Details**

“Festivals Unlocked” is an exhibition that brings new perspectives to six age-old Chinese festivals – Chinese New Year, Qingming, Duanwu, Zhongyuan, Mid-Autumn, and Winter Solstice. Each festival and the values they embody are brought to life through a locker, inviting students to “unlock” surprising origins and distinctive practices behind each festival. Beyond legends and fun facts, personal stories contributed by students reflect the diverse ways in which each festival is celebrated by Chinese Singaporean families. Exhibition texts are in English and Chinese. An area of 25m2 will be ideal for the exhibition, with a recommended three to four-week display period at each campus. Co-organised by Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, Nan Chiau High School, and Nanyang Girls’ High School.
