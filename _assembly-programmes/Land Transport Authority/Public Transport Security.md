This programme aims to raise security awareness and emergency preparedness amongst students, with a focus on upper primary & secondary school students as we believe they would better understand information relating to terrorism, be more likely to commute independently on our Public Transport Network and would be able to better appreciate and apply self-help skills during times of emergencies.

**Details**

The program will be shared via a sharing session during recess time as they gather at an area where a short presentation will be given and quiz and answer segment will be delivered. Collaterals will be given out to the students.

**Learning Objectives**
Students will learn what to do during emergency time be it on any other days or during a terrorist attack and what to look out for to prevent incidents like a terrorist attack that could have happen and how they can play a part to prevent it from happening. Skills of how to spot a suspicious character and basic first aid skills will be shared with the students.
