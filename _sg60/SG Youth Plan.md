<p>SG Youth Plan involves a series of engagements with various agencies to
get youths to share views, hopes and ideas that will shape their future.
The insights garnered will culminate in an <a href="https://www.youthplan.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Youth Plan</a> â€“ a five-year action
blueprint for 2026-2030.</p>
<p>MCCY and NYC would like to hear from as many youths as possible (15 to
35y/o). Students can access the <a href="https://crowdtask.gov.sg/quest/sg-youth-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Youth Plan quest page</a> to
take part in the surveys. There are various themes of interest to youths,
such as pathways of success, interpersonal relationships, and environment

The students can remain engaged on this platform when new and meaningful
tasks are added at later points in the year.</p>
