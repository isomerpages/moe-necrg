<p>In this Education and Career Guidance (ECG) experience, students will
step into the shoes of Career Detectives, Mission Planners, and Insight
Scouts to explore the many paths that keep Singapore safe and strong. The
session culminates in an inspirational sharing by a serving personnel or
veteran, offering authentic insights into career journeys, challenges,
and the sense of purpose behind defending our home.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong>
</p>
<p>Over the course of three hours, students will rotate through interactive
segments that reveal how diverse talents come together across the Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Digital Intelligence Service. As Career Detectives/Insight
Scouts, they will investigate real-world clues, decode tools of the trade,
and uncover the skills that define key defence vocations. Additionally,
students will reflect on their personal strengths, aspirations, and values
to discover how they, too, can play a part in Singapore’s defence ecosystem.</p>
