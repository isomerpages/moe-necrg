# OneEarth Challenge
The programme uses gamification to encourage primary school students to travel to school by car-lite modes. OneEarth inculcates car-lite attitudes and behaviours among school children and can potentially help to alleviate congestion outside schools. Beyond the car-lite theme, LTA also partners with relevant environmental agencies to deliver a holistic environmental messaging to students.

**Details**

Every morning, students scan in their individual QR cards at iPad stations and earn points for travelling by car-lite modes (walk/cycle/ride), and no points for travelling by car. Students work towards individual, team, and school goals.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will learn the importance of car-lite travel, and how they each can play their part to care for the environment.

> "Our teachers felt that the challenge offered many opportunities to instil values such as integrity, responsibility, and independence in the students."
