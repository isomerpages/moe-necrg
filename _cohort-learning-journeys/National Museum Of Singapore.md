# Artefactually Speaking: A Museum-Based Learning Programme
A programme that empowers students to decide what they want to learn more about in Singapore history!

**Details**

In this award-winning programme, which is also a CCE cohort learning journey for Secondary 2, students independently explore the museum galleries in groups, guided by a Passport activity booklet. Students will also get the opportunity to discover fascinating stories about specific artefacts throughout Singapore’s 700 years of history as they interact with our Museum Educators. There is also a special digital edition of the programme where students can learn more about the lives of the Amahs, Chettiars and Eunos Abdullah through interactive videos that allow them to choose the stories they wish to explore!

**Learning Objectives**
1. Understand how different groups or individuals in Singapore’s history created connections with one another, places and experiences.
3. Spark curiosity in students to think about connections in their daily lives.
