### Caring SG Commuters Movement

Commuting is an essential part of our day-to-day experience; it enables us to work, play and journey home at the end of each day. From conversations with our commuters, we know that the culture of care among them is important. The Caring SG Commuters Movement was thus started in August 2017 to foster a caring commuting culture in Singapore. The programmes enable commuters (e.g., students and educators) to have the opportunity to learn how to help one another and make commuting more inclusive and caring.
