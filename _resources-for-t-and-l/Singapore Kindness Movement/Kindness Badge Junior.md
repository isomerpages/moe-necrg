The Kindness Badge Junior programme recognises primary school students in Uniformed Groups as Ambassadors of Kindness.

**Details**

Kindness Badge Junior (KBJ) recognises primary school students in the Uniformed Groups as ambassadors of kindness. Using an activity booklet, students are required to carry out tasks and initiatives that promote kindness and graciousness in their CCA, schools, families and in the community. Upon completion, teachers-in-charge are to collate photos and videos of the activities done by students. After these files are submitted to SKM, participating students will be awarded the kindness badge. Educators may collect the activity booklets from: 
* Uniformed Group Headquarters (for Brownies & Cub Scouts) 
* SKM (for other UGs)

**Learning Objectives**

For primary students in student care to promote the values of kindness and graciousness in their community.
