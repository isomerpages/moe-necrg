A teachers’ self-help toolkit packed with activities to conduct in classrooms. Targeted at lower-primary students, the toolkit includes a Students’ Activity Book which contains worksheets and games; a Teachers’ Guide that provides suggestions for activities and learning points; and a video jingle.

**Details**

Teachers can go through the worksheets and activities with the students, explain the rationale of the safe riding behaviours to them, and conduct the suggested classroom activities from the Teachers’ Guide.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will find out more on how pedestrians and active mobility device users can share public paths safely and graciously. They will gain a better understanding of active mobility rules, safety tips and habits that they can adopt when walking or riding on public paths.
