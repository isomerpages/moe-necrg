# "SHARE YOUR STORY, SHAPE OUR MEMORIAL"
# TRAVELLING EXHIBITION AND PUBLIC CALL

Opening in 2027, the Founders’ Memorial will commemorate the founding values and ideals exemplified by Singapore’s founding leaders with a focus on the period of 1950s to 1970s in Singapore’s history, explored through the lens of deliberations, dilemmas and decisions that illustrate how our leaders and people were guided through the tumultuous nation-building years by founding values such as multiculturalism, resilience, and openness. Distilled from the Memorial’s continued engagement with Singaporeans since its inception in 2015, these values have become foundational to Singapore, and continue to underpin who we are today as a people and nation.

Earlier this year, the Founders’ Memorial launched the ‘Share Your Story, Shape Our Memorial’ travelling exhibition that features a public call for artefacts and stories. This exhibition presents Singapore’s nation-building years and introduces some of the founding values that will anchor the Memorial’s content. The travelling exhibition kicked off at Gardens by the Bay on 28 April 2022 and is currently travelling to various locations around the island, including shopping malls, community hubs, libraries and schools, till February 2023. An online version of the
travelling exhibition is also available in all four languages and can be accessed via our multilingual website. A contribution form to the public call is also available online for students who have parents or grandparents with relevant stories and artefacts to access and fill out.

**Details**

This is a travelling exhibition with a complementary microsite featuring an online version of the exhibition and a contribution form for submissions to the public call.

**Learning Objectives**

Students will learn about the founding values and ideals exemplified by Singapore’s founding leaders and generation with a focus on the period of 1950s to 1970s in Singapore’s history. They will also be introduced to key milestones and policies in our independence period, as told through lesser known stories behind artefacts from our National Collection. Students are also encouraged to interact
with older family members who lived through the period to encourage them to submit stories and artefacts that could help shape greater understanding of our journey as a nation.
